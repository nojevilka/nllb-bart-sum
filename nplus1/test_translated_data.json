    "translated_text": "Scientists in England and France have tested whether the fetus in the womb can respond to food eaten by the mother. To do this, researchers gave pregnant women capsules containing kale powder or carrots, and then used ultrasound to track the fetal appearance. It turns out that the kids don't like cabbage very much. They make a crying face, and the carrots make them smile. The results of the study were published in Psychological Science. Intrauterine development is an important stage for all future life. During this time, one cell becomes a full human, the internal organs are formed and developed, and our taste habits are likely to be determined. Scientists have long noted that mothers who ate garlic during pregnancy had babies who did not experience this specific smell from the first few hours of life. But the effect of food on babies was tracked after birth, so it was unclear when exactly a person could start to react to food. Jacqueline Blissett of the University of Aston, along with her colleagues, decided to investigate whether children can respond to different foods in the womb. Women at 32 and 34 weeks of pregnancy were given capsules with carrot or cabbage powder. The subjects themselves did not know what was inside, so their personal preferences could not influence the course of the experiment (but they could guess the contents by the color of the capsules). 25 minutes later, the fetus' reaction was scanned on a face-to-face ultrasound. The scientists defined emotion by the look of the face: lower eyebrows and open mouths were considered a sign of dissatisfaction, and raised eyebrows and cheeks were considered a positive emotion. Scientists have traced many of the features of the look, but they all combine into a \"crying\" or \"laughing\" face. It turns out that humans can actually react to food before they are born. If a pregnant woman ate a carrot capsule, the fetus was more likely to have a \"laughing\" face. But they didn't like the cabbage, on the contrary. The crying face was twice as common in this case as when eating carrots or being quiet. During intrauterine development, the fetus floats in the amniotic fluid, where substances from the mother's food can get into. It is unclear what system the fetus uses to sense and react to these substances. The authors of the study believe that the trigeminal nerve is most likely involved in both taste, smell, and chemical stimulation. together or separately. Someone says children are the flowers of life. And you can check if you know the real colors by taking the \"complex flowers\" test. The other one is Pauline Grebenkin."

    "translated_title": "Archaeologists have unearthed the burial site of the Athanasians \"Romeo and Juliet\" in Altai",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have discovered a paired burial of two teenagers who died at the age of 1012 years in the late IV first half of the III millennium BC. These children, possibly a boy and a girl, were buried inside a megalithic structure made of large stone slabs along with two ceramic vessels and a buckle bracelet. The unofficially discovered remains were called the \"Romeo and Juliet\" by the Athanasians. This is reported on the website of Altai State University. In the Age of Eneolit/early Bronze, the first cattle ranchers and metallurgists of Southern Siberia came from the tribes of the Afanasiev archaeological culture. This population was characterized by a distinctly European-like anthropological type. Paleogeneic studies have shown that the Athanasians are closely related to the pits culture that existed in the steppes of Eastern Europe about 40002300 years before our era. Monuments of the Afanasiev culture are known in Altai, Minusine, and also in the territory of Shinjian and Mongolia. According to radiocarbon dating, it existed in the late 4th  first half of the 3rd millennium BC. The Athanasians lived along the banks of large rivers and their tributaries, as indicated by the numerous tombs and settlements found on high terraces above the cliffs. Archaeologists have identified two types of burial structures of the Athanasians. Often, round stone fences made of vertical stone slabs are found, the height of which in antiquity exceeded a meter above the ground. Rarely, small round earthen mounds made of ripped stones (walls-walls) are found. They buried their dead usually alone, rarely by two people (e.g., adults and children or children's burial pairs). They were usually placed on their backs or on their right side, with their legs bent in the knees, and also painted with a ochre. Most of the accompanying inventory from the burial sites of the Afanasievs is made of ceramic vessels, including typical smokers (lighthouses), although sometimes stone, bone, metal and wood items are also found. Archaeologists from Kazakhstan and Russia under the leadership of Sergey Grushin of Altai State University took part in the expedition to search for burials of the Turkish era as part of the project \"Big Altai: Turkish heritage. The Sentel is 2022\". During the work on the ancient tombs of Ust-Thopla and Little Tatar, located in the Chariş district of the Altai region, they found an unusual burial site of the paleo-metal era. The researchers discovered a megalithic burial structure built of large stone slabs, buried vertically in the ground. Inside this fence was a burial pit covered with large stone blocks. According to Sergei Grushin, archaeologists had hoped to find inside the tomb the remains of a man  representing the aphanasievskaya top or a servant of the cult. However, the burial site contained the bones of two teenagers (possibly a boy and a girl) who died at about 1012 years of age. These children were buried on their backs with their legs bent in the knees. The accompanying inventory included a clay pot, one of which was unusual in shape. In addition, the left hands of both children were made of pastry bracelets. It is noted that such large burial facilities for teenagers of this period were not usually built. The remains of the children were unofficially named \"Romeo and Juliet\" by the Athanasians. Previously, N+1 had already reported on studies on the culture of the Athanasians. For example, archaeologists have unearthed the first settlement of metalworkers and livestock farmers in Altai, and have clarified the time of existence of the Afanasiev culture in Minusynsk. In addition, the researchers found that the Athanasians brought livestock culture to Mongolia. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "Paleontologist has reduced the giant prehistoric rodents",
    "translated_text": "An American paleontologist has revised the size of the giant rodents Phoberomys pattersoni and Josephoartigasia monesi. Previous estimates of their masses ranged from 234 to 741 kilograms in the first species and from 350 to 2586 kilograms in the second. However , the scientist estimated the mass of P. Pattersoni weighs only 108212 kilograms, and J. Monesi is 254 576 kg. The study was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The largest modern rodent is the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). Its weight can reach up to 91 kilograms, but the average weight of this species is between 35 and 65.5 kilograms. However, in the past, there were much larger rodents. The largest are Phoberomys pattersoni of the extinct neoepiblemid family (Neoepiblemidae) and Josephoartigasia monesi of the pecan family (Dinomyidae). Both species lived in South America, the first in the late Miocene, and the second in the late Pliocene  early Pleistocene. Originally mass P. Pattersoni estimated the weight at 436741 kilograms, and J. Monesi is 4682586 kg (average 1211 kg). In subsequent studies, their weight varied from 234 to 655 kilograms in P. Pattersoni and 350 to 917 kilograms at J. I'm going to the monastery. However, all of these estimates are not very reliable because these species differ in proportions from modern ones, and J. Monesi is also known only from the skull. Russell Engelman (born Russell K. Engelman) of Case Western Reserve University proposed a new method of estimating the body weight of giant rodents. In his previous work on a large sample of mammals, he showed that the width of the hindwings is strongly correlated with body weight. Using this method to target giant rodents, the scientist found that given the correction coefficient of mass P. Pattersoni weighs 108127 kilograms, and J's weight is about 108. Monesi is 254 kg. In addition, the paleontologist estimated their body mass based on other parameters, including the length of the skull. The maximum values obtained were 212 kilograms for P. Pattersoni and 576 kilograms for J. I'm going to the monastery. So the body weight of these rodents was not more than 600 kilograms, but the author notes that they remain giants anyway. The Lagomorpha, unlike rodents, have never reached such enormous size. Zoologists explain this by the fact that their size limits competition with capillaries and rodents. The Seed of Frost"

    "translated_title": "Self-induction in the polaritone condensate prolonged the beats of its coherence.",
    "translated_text": "Physicists from England, Iceland and Russia reported finding an unusual back dynamic of exiton-polaritone condensate pumped by a fairly long laser pulse. They showed that under certain experimental conditions, condensate coherence experiences beats that last much longer than the life of individual quasiparticles. Modeling showed that the self-induced larmoral precession of the pseudospine is responsible for this behavior. The study was published in Physical Review Letters. Most quantum technologies, including quantum computing, rely on the ability of quantum systems to be in a superposition state. First of all, these properties are the atoms and molecules of the smallest objects available for manipulation. Larger structures, such as quantum points and superconducting contours, are also suitable for the role of qubits, but they only serve as environments for demonstrating superposition properties to a number of electrons. But it turns out that quantum laws can actually exist as macroscopic objects -- Bose condensates -- Einstein. They are a large number of any boson particles, united by a single macroscopic state. Normally, very low temperatures are needed to create a Bose-Condensate atom. However, exiton-polaritone condensates also exist in room conditions, making them much easier to work with. Exitone-polyaritone is the hybrid state of light and excitation of atoms or crystal lattice (for more information on what these particles are and how they form boses-condensates, see Quantum Centaurs). It's made by pumping the medium with a laser. Under certain conditions, these quasiparticles condense into two possible states corresponding to the upper and lower polaritone branches, thus realizing a macroscopic two-level system. Physicists introduce the concept of pseudoscience to describe its dynamics. Unlike atoms or molecules that are always in some state, the pseudospinic components of the exiton-polaritone condensate can tend to zero, which corresponds to decay in the macroscopic state and loss of coherence. These processes were investigated by a group of physicists from England, Iceland, and Russia, led by Alexis Askitopoulos of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. They observed that under certain conditions, the coherence of polaritone condensate subjected to optical non-resonant pumping decreases non-monotonically, demonstrating beats, with the duration of these beats significantly exceeding the life of the quasiparticles themselves. The authors explained the sight using a self-induced larmoral precession of the pseudospine. In their study, the scientists used a semiconductor micro-resonator with a quantum hole embedded in it. The non-resonant laser radiation, 20 microseconds in duration with circular polarization, excited exiton-polaritones in the sample, which formed an imbalanced condensate on the back. To prevent the condensate from losing its coherence due to interaction with the reservoir of uncondensed particles, physicists isolated it using an optical trap. The authors carried out interferometric measurements over the condensate with a time delay, tracking the behavior of the characteristic interference bands. Physicists were interested in the dependence of the delay time of phase contrast at different ends of the condensate and the correlation function of the first order, between the wave functions (or, more precisely, the spinors) of the condensate between two arbitrary points. The last one was a report on the degree of coherence of the condensate. It turned out that starting with some density threshold of the condensed polaritones, which the scientists controlled using laser parameters, the correlations in the condensate were tested up to eight beating periods of a total duration of about one nanosecond, with the typical life span of quasiparticles being about five picoseconds. To explain the observed behavior, the authors numerically solved the system of the Gross  Pitaevsky generalized equations, which describes the feeding relationship of the reservoir to both states of the condensate. It turns out that the oscillatory behavior of coherence is well described by the mechanism of a self-induced magnetic field directed outside the plane of the quantum hole that causes the pseudo-spine of the condensate to pressurise around itself. It is noteworthy that this precession naturally occurs due to a disruption in symmetry due to back imbalance. The final condition of the condensate (namely the trajectory on the Bloh sphere) in the beat scenario is not dependent on the starting point, although it is sensitive to the intensity and polarization of the laser. The authors suggest that the unusual spinal dynamics they discovered may be useful in magnetometry and in creating spinal-compressed states of polaritone condensate. We recently talked about how Chinese physicists achieved a subpeccus-second switch of exiton-polarite-boz condensate at room temperature. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_text": "British engineer and blogger Adam Beedle has developed a device that tracks a person's feet and throws sharp LEGO pieces underneath them. LEGO parts are mostly in the shape of a parallel-piped or, simply put, a brick with sharp 90-degree angles. It's convenient for assembling a variety of designs, but often some of the design parts fall on the floor and stay there, and it hurts so much to step on them that it's a meme, and in some countries, there are LEGO barefoot walking competitions. Adam Beadle decided to create a device that not only doesn't solve this problem, but instead throws the design details right under people's feet. It's pretty simple and it works like an arbalest, but with automatic aiming. The device has a 17 part 3D print shop (a two by four rectangular brick). Under the store is a rack that is moved backwards by a motorcycle and replaced by a lower part. The reck moves with a six-and-a-half-tooth handle, so through the half-turn the clutch disappears and the part is pushed out with stretched rubber at high speed. The targeting is done by a standard camera, electric motor, rotary device, and the OpenCV computer vision library. Initially, Biddle planned to track the feet, but failed to get the job done and decided to use bright red socks and color detection. He eventually taught the arbaleto to follow a man's feet and throw LEGO pieces into them so he could step on them and suffer. LEGO has more peaceful applications in amateur engineering projects. For example, we talked about a designer device that folds paper planes and launches them. Grigory Kopiyev"

    "translated_text": "The South American Guriurius minuano is a species of spider known to science. It was discovered by a team of arachnologists from Brazil and Uruguay. A description of the new species was published in an article for Zootaxa. As noted in the World Catalogue of Spiders press release, scientists still do not know about fifty thousand spider species  and it will take less than a hundred years to describe them. Spiders are an extremely numerous and diverse group of leg-and-body spiders. They live all over the world, from freshwater to mountain tops. Many spiders have mastered unusual hunting techniques, including creating cunning traps and collective hunting. And among them are the unexpectedly bright species that perform elaborate wedding dances to attract partners. The first scientific descriptions of spiders were published in 1757. The authors were Swedish naturalist Carl Alexander Clerck, who gave the Latin names to 67 of the group. Since then, arachnologists have managed to describe several tens of thousands more spider species, and this list is regularly updated. Recently, the publishers of the World Spider Catalog (WSC), based at the Museum of Natural History in Bern, announced that the number of described spider species has reached fifty thousand. The southern American Guriurius minuano, a species of juvenile shrub, is native to forests and shrublands in southern Brazil, Uruguay, and the surrounding areas of Buenos Aires. A team of nutritionists led by Kimberly da Silva Marta of the University of the Rio dos Sinos Valley named it after the extinct Minanos Indian tribe. In addition, the same word denotes the cold western or southwestern winds that blow in the habitats of the new species from March to September. I wonder if G. The minuano is not only a new species, but also a new species of spider. Martha and her colleagues also described a second species of this genus, G. I'm not. He lives in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It is estimated that there are about a hundred thousand species of spiders on Earth. It took 265 years for the first 50,000 of them to be described. However, the speed at which arachnologists discover new species of spiders is increasing, so the remaining 50,000 species are likely to be described in less than a hundred years. A few years ago, zoologists calculated how much prey all the spiders in the world eat. It turns out that the total biomass of their victims per year is between 400 and 800 million tons. That's about a hundredth of all the raw materials on the planet. Sergei Kelenov"

    "translated_title": "In Poland, a possible burial site for Danish conundrum Harald Sinezboog has been discovered.",
    "translated_text": "Using satellite imagery, a team of researchers has been able to locate the probable burial place of Danish king Harald I Sinezubog, after whom Bluetooth wireless communication technology is named. In the vicinity of the Polish city of Volyn, they found a massive kurgan, near which a chapel stood in the Middle Ages. In the middle of the 19th century, a gold disc of Harald Sinezubog was found near the mound, which was believed to be part of the king's burial equipment. The preliminary results of the study can be found on Academia's website. I'm not going to be here. In the middle of the 9th century (probably around 958) Harald Gormsson, nicknamed the Sinezubian, came to power in Denmark. He not only consolidated his power over much of Jutland and Zealand with his headquarters in the city of Elling, but even became the ruler of Norway for a time. Perhaps in order to improve his relations with his neighbors, such as the Holy Roman Empire, Harald first got baptized himself, and then the whole of Denmark officially became a Christian country. At the end of his reign he fought a civil war with his own son  Sven I Viloborodim, during which, according to one version, he was killed in 986 (or 985). It is believed that Harald died in the city of Yomsborg  a fortress mentioned in the sagas, but its existence has not been confirmed by archaeologists. Historians suggest that if this city existed, it must have been located at the mouth of the Oder, where the Polish city of Volyn now lies. In honor of Harald, Bluetooth wireless communication technology is named, and its logo is a combination of two runes: the junior futarks () and Berkan () hagalz, which correspond to the initials of the H and B conundrum. The Polish science popularizer Marek Kryda, who lives in the United States, presented preliminary results of the search for the burial of Harald I Sinisezbo. He and a group of researchers studied images obtained by space satellites and discovered a large 33-meter-diameter and three-meter-high kurgan in the village of Weikow, six kilometers from the Polish city of Volyn (West Pomerania). It was then suggested that it might be the burial place where the remains of Harald I lay. Now it's being studied using a georadar. According to Kryd, the curgan is near the 19th-century church, which was built on the ruins of an older medieval chapel. In 2014, Swedish archaeologist Sven Rosborn, who specializes in the Viking Age, concluded that the remains of the Danish king were accidentally discovered in 1841 in a burial chamber near the local church. At the same time, several artifacts were found (and in 2014 scientists learned about them), including a silver coin from the reign of Otto I the Great, a bronze bracelet, and a gold disc of Harald Sinezubog (Gomson's disc). On the front of the latter object, a plate about 4.5 centimetres (4.5 in) in diameter and 25.23 grams in weight, is an inscription in Latin with a mention of the Danish conundrum Harald Gormsson. The researchers suggested that Harald Sinezubai did not want to be buried in a church because he continued to be a pagan in many ways, even though he had introduced Christianity to Denmark. For this reason, he may have wanted his burial under a moat. Sven Robson believes that the 11th-century North German chronicler Adam Bremensky was wrong in bringing the body of the deceased Harald to the Roskiller Cathedral (then a wooden church was on the site of this burial place of the Danish kings). Previously on N+1, they were talking about other Viking burial surveys. For example, Norwegian archaeologists have completed excavations of the ship burial ground at Gellestad. Another burial mound found this year is yet to be examined. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "Anapolis of the spine of nature suggested looking for the hydrogen atom in the spectra",
    "translated_text": "British and Singaporean physicists have investigated the role of the spine in the formation of the atom of the thoracic dipole moment (anapolis). It turns out that the transitions have unique selection rules, and so you can see these spectral lines in the experiment. Scientists have given the conditions under which this becomes possible for hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms. The study was published in Science Advances. The theory of electromagnetic interaction with matter in application to specific tasks is very often based on multiple decomposition. Within its framework, the influence of arbitrary charge distribution even inside a neutral body is represented as the sum of deposits from ordered charge configurations: electric monopolies, dipoles, quadrupols, and so on. Physicists also displace the currents running through matter, forming magnetic manifolds. The exception is the magnetic monopoly, which physicists have not found (though actively seeking). However, in 1957, Soviet physicist Jakov Zeldovich pointed out that static multipol decomposition loses a specific class of configurations that can only manifest itself in a dynamic case. In particular, currents in the body can flow along the meridians of a tower on its surface. In this case, they're talking about dynamic torus moments or anapolis. These configurations remain a topic of discussion among physicists to this day, although scientists have discovered the contribution of analogues to the radiation of metamaterials and nanoparticles, and have also considered them as candidates for dark matter or objects for non-radiation communication based on the Aaronov  Bohm effect. You can learn more about the latter from the words of one of the authors of the study, Alexei Basharin. The study of dynamic torid moments is largely based on the notion of light and matter through the prism of classical Maxwell magnetism. Experimentally, this is justified by the specific electrical and magnetic properties of the artificial materials used for this purpose. But for atoms and molecules, this approach is not complete, because relativistic quantum effects play an important role in their expression in the presence of spin electrons. To close this gap, a group of physicists from the UK and Singapore led by Nikolay Zheludev of Nanyang Technological University theoretically identified a contribution in the interaction of the atom with radiation corresponding to the dynamic three-dimensional moment of the spinal cord. They showed that this element would have specific selection rules that can be seen even in hydrogen-like atom experiments. In classical physics, the source of magnetism  is the current that moves along a closed trajectory. Relativistic quantum mechanics has shown that electrons have an additional degree of freedom  spin, which also contributes to the magnetic moment. The name \"spin\" comes from the naïve interpretation of the spine as the charged particle's own spin, although in a strict sense it is a separate entity that is only compared (composed and subtracted) with orbital motion in terms of angular moments. Orbital and spinal moments differ also in how they form atomic magnetism and how sensitive they are to optical transitions of various manifolds. For example, an electric dipole transition, i.e. radiation or absorption by a process in which an atom is represented exclusively as a dipole, is accompanied by a change in the ∆L orbital moment of the L atom per unit (and its mL projection at 0 and ± 1), and a change in the spin moment of ms is impossible. The magnetic dipole transition is different in that its ∆L is always zero, but ms can be changed to one. Because electric dipole transitions contribute significantly more than others, spectral lines that violate their selection rules are often called forbidden. By studying the Tory dipole transitions in a hydrogen atom, physicists have seen that their selection rules differ from those for any other transitions. In particular, the change in orbital moment in them is allowed to be one (∆L = ± 1), as in an electric dipole, and the spin number  to zero and one (∆ms = 0, ± 1), as in a magnetic dipole. The problem is that it's going to be difficult to see these transitions because they're going to be masked by already known spectral lines. To help solve these problems, the authors suggest using a strong (somewhat tense) magnetic field that competes with spin-orbit interactions and allows for the division of atomic levels by corresponding quantum numbers. Their calculations suggest that the new transitions can be clearly seen by placing the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of five tesla and exploring its transition from 2 to 51 orbit by absorbing light at a wavelength of 364 nanometers. Although the new transitions will have separate frequencies, they may still be invisible due to the proximity of traditional lines, as the matrix element of the dipole transition is quite small. To combat excessive noise, theorists suggest using a method of privately modulated spectroscopy, filtering the fluorescence signal, and replacing hydrogen with hydrogen-like lithium, which will have larger frequency intervals. Finally, the new effect is not true of the inversion of time. In other words, the shifting of lines will have a different sign in different directions of the magnetic field or the polarization of light. This means that the signal should be searched in differential mode, switching the field constantly. Although atomic physics is a subject of physics, research like the one described above continues to emerge. We recently talked about how theorists proposed a scheme to produce a spin-polarized, metastable matter in which all electrons are oriented in the same direction in atoms."

    "translated_title": "An analysis of 777 ancient genomes has clarified the origins of the paleometallic age populations",
    "translated_text": "Paleogenetics analyzed 777 ancient genomes from Anatolia, Southeastern Europe, and Western Asia spanning the last ten thousand years of human history. By focusing their attention on the Paleo-metal era, scientists found that there was no flow of genes from Europe to Anatolia during the entire Bronze Age. They also clarified the influence of representatives of the pit culture (or those genetically related to it) on other populations. So scientists found Y-chromosome lines in Armenia and Iran. According to the researchers, all ancient and modern Indo-European languages can be traced back to the time of the Pit culture. This is reported in an article published in the journal Science. Most of the ancient European populations were descended from a few ancestral groups. A small part of the mix is attributed to western European hunter-gatherers, descendants of the Cromannians, who lived in Europe during the Pleistocene. A recent study has shown that during the height of the last ice age, two hunter-gatherer populations formed on the continent, which may have corresponded to the carriers of the Salutrian and Epigravian archaeological cultures during the late Paleolithic. In the early Neolithic period, the first Anatolian farmers entered Europe, arriving in the Balkans in the 7th millennium BC. Gradually, the descendants of these people spread across the continent, leading to a near complete change in the genome. Another important ancestral component came to Europe from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, where the early bronze age had created a pits archaeological culture. These tribes (or their genetic relatives) are linked by large migrations. Thus, in South Siberia and the surrounding regions, the first livestock and metalworkers of the region were the Afanasievs. In addition, migration to Europe led to the spread of \"step\" genes. A recent study found that migration was mainly male. One hypothesis is that the spread of Indo-European languages is linked to the culture of the pits. A group of scientists led by Joseph Lazaridis (Iosif Lazaridis) and David Reich (David Reich) of Harvard University sequenced 727 ancient genomes (in addition to 50 previously published) from the region they propose to call \"Southern Arc\"  Anatolia and adjacent regions of Southeast Europe and Western Asia. The genomes read cover the last ten thousand years of human history, but the researchers focused their attention primarily on the Age of Enolith and Bronze (about 50001000 years before our era). In addition, scientists have obtained 239 new radiocarbon dating for bone fragments, from which DNA was extracted. To find out the origin of the individuals studied, scientists developed a model with five ancestral components: Caucasian hunter-gatherers (CHG), Eastern European hunter-gatherers (EHG), Levantine pre-Neolithic farmers, Balkan hunter-gatherers, and Neolithic farmers from Northwest Anatolia. Applying this model to the inhabitants of Anatolia, paleogenesis discovered that by the end of the Bronze Age, the ancestors of these people had come from Western Asia, with only a small share of Balkan and Eastern European hunter-gatherers. In this region, they found a tendency to gradually decrease the Anatolian ancestral component and increase the contribution from Caucasian and Levantine populations. In general, the genetic history of Anatolia in the Age of Enolith and Bronze was characterized by scientists as gradual homogenization, although some differences in different regions still persisted. It's worth noting that there was no flow of genes from Europe to Anatolia during this period. Paleogenetics also decided to find out the origin of the representatives of the pits archaeological culture. Although they were unable to give a definitive answer to this question, they did draw some conclusions. For example, in the period after 5000 BC, steppe people were brought from the Eastern European hunter-gatherers by the Caucasian hunter-gatherers. This is typical of prairie and maykop culture. For a long time, steppe people lacked ancestral components from Anatolia or Levant, which appear after 3000 BC. That suggests two streams of genes from the south. The total contribution from the second wave is estimated to be about 6.5 percent. Scientists have confirmed the contribution of the population of such wells to European war axe cultures and the tradition of bell-shaped cups. At the same time, they found in some populations an excessively large ancestral component derived from Caucasian hunter-gatherers. Paleogenetists estimate that in the Neolithic era, 5.2 ± 0.6 percent of the population was already mixed with this species in Southeastern Europe. Unlike Anatolia, where more of the same population was concentrated, the Balkans had a reverse situation. For example, descendants of local hunter-gatherers have survived. For example, paleogenetists have discovered in Serbia a bronze age individual (about 24602296 BC) whose ancestral component from ancient hunter-gatherers is 37 percent. In addition, scientists have discovered in the Balkans early bronze age people whose origins are modeled as follows: 35.9 ± 2.5 percent  from eastern European hunter-gatherers, 36.4 ± 1.9  from Caucasian hunter-gatherers and 23 ± 1.9  from Neolithic farmers from Anatolia. The wells have these indicators: 46,1 ± 1, 46,6 ± 1,6 and 3,0 ± 1, that is, about the same ratio, but with the addition of one fifth from Anatolian farmers. Scientists believe that the steppe mix appeared in populations in Southeastern Europe about 4,850 years ago, that is, just after the expansion of the pits. Armenia has earned the attention of researchers. It turned out that the main ancestral component of the local inhabitants from the Neolithic era to the present day are Caucasian hunter-gatherers, who account for about 5070 percent. Much of the rest of the mix, like in Anatolia, is from Western Asia. It is noteworthy that about 6000 years ago, during the Age of Ennaolit, genes from eastern European hunter-gatherers appeared in Armenia (the first evidence of the appearance of the peoples of the Eurasian steppe in Western Asia), but after about a thousand years they disappeared. They reappeared in the Middle Bronze Age, when their share was about 14 percent. Gradually, it was declining and by the second half of the first millennium B.C.E., it was about one-third. Analysis of Y-chromosome lines associated with the pits and the Aphanassian cultures allowed scientists to confirm the presence of the descendants of these people in the Bronze Age not only in Southeastern Europe or Siberia, but also in Armenia, as well as Iran, where there is no archaeological evidence of pits left behind. For example, the R-Z2103 haplogroup subclasses are present in Armenia to this day. In particular, scientists have hypothesized that the genetic diversity in the Balkans may indicate that the region had a \"lingua franca\" in antiquity. They suggested that the ancient Indo-European language Paleo-Balkans, whose only descendant is now Albanian, might have been appropriate for this role. Based on the results of the paleogenetic study, the scientists also hypothesized the origin and spread of Indo-European and Anatolian languages, but emphasized that the link between genetics and linguistics is very ambiguous. So language can change almost without changing the gene pool, and populations can migrate and mix with other groups without changing the language. Researchers noted that past discoveries of steppe migrations to Central and Western Europe, as well as to Southern Siberia and Central and South Asia, have become arguments in favor of the theory of the steppe origin of Indo-European languages. The current study also shows the presence of steppe in the Balkans and Armenia. According to scholars, all the ancient and modern branches of Indo-European languages can be traced back to the early Bronze Age. Previously on N+1, they told us about the origins of the oldest farmers. For example, paleogenetics have discovered that they were formed from three ancestral populations: the people of Anatolia, the Natufian culture, and hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus or Iran.

    "translated_title": "Neolithic Maltese people caught in a brawl",
    "translated_text": "Paleogenetists have read three genomes of people who lived in the third millennium BC on one of the Maltese islands, and they have found that the DNA of all these individuals contains evidence of inbreeding. Moreover, the number of homogenous genes in one of these people was the second largest among all known prehistoric genomes. He was probably descended from close relatives. Scientists have concluded that in the late Neolithic period, the local population was very small and barely received a gene flow from people living outside the island. This is reported in an article published in the journal Current Biology. The first settlements in Malta date back to the Neolithic period, and date back to the 6th millennium BC. For a long time, the local people maintained contact with neighboring regions, which is reflected in archaeological finds. However, about 3600 B.C.E., in the so-called age of megalithic temples, local pottery and architecture began to differ markedly. One of the manifestations of local culture was the construction of multi-cameral rock tombs. Such burials were discovered during excavations of the Brochtorff Circle (Stone Circle in Shaare), which is located on the island of Gozo. This monument is an underground temple that was first discovered in the 1820s. Later excavations have revealed a ritual area, megalithic altars, prehistoric artifacts, and the remains of at least 800 people (at least 220,000 bones). One of the earliest chamber tombs of this monument dates from about 36003300 years, but the burials in the hypogeum were a little later. Radiocarbon analysis showed that people were buried there for about 600 years until 2350 BC. A group of scientists from Australia, Great Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Canada and Malta led by Daniel Bradley of Trinity College decided to conduct a genetic study of the remains excavated at the Brochtorff Circle. In three samples (Xaghra-5, Xaghra-6, Xaghra-9) they found good DNA preservation, so they were able to read genomes with an average coverage of 0.98 to 7.52 times. The oldest of these people (Xaghra-6) died about 29002650 BC, the other two 25502350 BC. Using F-statistics, scientists have found in the Maltese genomes a stream of genes associated with early Neolithic populations from Italy and Greece, less than  from the population of Italy and Sicily of the Middle Neolithic and Halcolithic. It is noteworthy that the three individuals studied had the lowest number of ancestral components obtained from western hunter-gatherers (6.8±2.5 percent) among other populations of the late Neolithic. In addition, D-statistics showed that these people lacked a mix of North African and Caucasian hunter-gatherers, Iranian Neolithic farmers or steppe people (Yama culture). A study of the close-knit crossover showed that the Xaghra-9 genome contains a significant number of homogenous genes  among prehistoric humans more than only in a Neolithic individual (Newgrange-10), whose remains were found in Ireland. The last, according to scientists, was a descendant of his closest relatives. The Maltese individual found this to be in a border situation. He may also have been a descendant of close relatives, rather than a man from Israel of the Halcolithic era (I-1178), who was previously identified as a descendant of a brother and sister or a parent and child. However, paleogenetics have suggested that, perhaps, in the case of an individual from Malta, homogenization may also be explained by several incidents of inbreeding in his genealogy. Evidence of inbreeding has been found in two other Maltese genomes. Paleogenetists have used two different methods to estimate the effective size of the local population at 382 or 515. According to scientists, in the early Neolithic era, the island of Gozo may have had up to twothree thousand inhabitants. However, about 5500 B.C.E., the climate became drier, and the soil began to degrade, leading to a decline in the local population in the late Neolithic. Scientists concluded that the individuals studied belonged to a population that practically did not share genes with people from outside Gozo. Although there is archaeological evidence of contact with other regions in Malta  imported obsidian and cream, it is likely that this exchange of goods was not accompanied by substantial genetic exchange. Moreover, the methods of farming and construction were local, further confirming the isolation of the local population. Previously, N+1 was talking about other paleogenetic studies on European Neolithic populations. For example, molecular biologists have discovered the importance of kinship in burials in a long mound excavated in Gloucestershire, England. In addition, scientists have clarified the origin of the ancient inhabitants of Croatia. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_text": "British archaeologists have unearthed an ancient tomb in the necropolis of the capital of the Egyptian king Akhenaten. Inside it lay the remains of several people, including a young woman who lived during the reign of the XVIII dynasty. At the site, researchers found precious jewelry made of gold and talclorite: a necklace and three rings. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities reports on its Facebook page*. On the eastern bank of the Nile, about three hundred kilometers from Cairo, is the Tel-el-Amarna (Amarna) monument complex. It is the remains of the ancient Egyptian city of Ahetaton (\"Horizon of Athon\") - the capital city built in the 14th century BC by King Akhenaten (the same  Amenhotep IV), who is known for his religious reform and the introduction of the cult of the god Athon. Akhetaton was a beautiful white-stone city with richly decorated palaces and temples, but it did not last long. Soon after the unexpected death of Akhenaten, it was abandoned, and the last pharaoh of the XVIII dynasty, Horemheb, ordered the city to be destroyed. Researchers began to show interest in the capital city of Ehnaton in the 18th century, but large-scale excavations began only in 1891. Among the discoveries made at this complex of monuments, the so-called Amarna letters (a large body of cuneiform texts), works of the Aarhagyan period of ancient Egyptian art, tombs, as well as ruins of palaces and temples stand out. Since 1977, the excavations of Tel-el-Amarna have been carried out by archaeologists from the University of Cambridge. The British Archaeological Mission from Cambridge University has conducted new excavations at the Tel-el-Amarna necropolis. In a small underground tomb from the XVIII Dynasty (1550-1292 BC) they discovered the remains of a young woman wrapped in cloth and a cyno. There were a few more people here. However, the female burial attracted more attention because along with the remains, they found precious jewels made of gold and talclorite. Among them were a necklace with leaf-shaped pendants, as well as three rings. One of them adorned the image of the god Bess, who protected people from evil forces and who helped households, mothers, and children. The other ring has a hieroglyphic inscription. Previously, N+1 reported other finds from the New Kingdom period. In Luxor, archaeologists have discovered an ancient Egyptian city of artisans dating back to the 14th century BC. And in the Sakkara necropolis, 52 intact sarcophagi with mummies of officials and nobles were found. *Facebook is owned by Meta, which is banned in Russia."

    "translated_text": "Danish and British researchers have concluded that After the ban on industrially produced trans fats in food introduced in Denmark In 2003, the number of deaths from ischemic heart disease (IBS) in the country decreased. about 11 percent. The results of the work are published It's in the magazine PLoS ONE. Trans-isomers of unsaturated fatty acids in small The amount of cysteine in the meat and milk (cysis isomers are present in vegetable fats).

According to estimates, each The extra percentage of calories per day that trans fats produce increases The mortality rate from these diseases is about 12 percent. Because of this, many countries have introduced legislative restrictions. or complete prohibitions on industrial trans fats in products (Denmark was in this The first . The World Health Organization in 2018 presented six-stage plan to exclude them from global food supply and included this issue in the overall work programme for 20192023 It's a year. To quantify the effects of the trans fats ban, The Danish Institute of Technology and the Danish Institute of Technology The University of Liverpool under the leadership of Kirsten Scroll Björnsbo (Kirsten) Schroll Bjoernsbo) used the general population data of the Danish the central civil registration department from 1991 to 2007. Population They divided into 60 layers based on sex, six age groups (2534, 3544, 4554, 5564, 6574 and 7584 years) and five socioeconomic quintiles (according to the data (the State Statistical Service on Income and Taxation).

According to the model, with this directly The number of deaths from IBS is down 1191 cases (95 percent confidence The interval is 9891409). All that happened in 2007 11 out of 110 deaths from IBS are less than expected at the level of 1991. That 's it .

    "translated_title": "Robocub with a balance and a machete held on to the only point of support",
    "translated_text": "Swiss engineers have developed a new version of the robotic Cube Cubli, which can now balance at one point of support using a passive balancer and only one powered motor. The creators told IEEE Spectrum magazine about how it works. There are many designs in robotics that are inspired by the animal world and can maintain balance. For example, the human-like Atlas robot, which can run, do a back-salt, and do a parkour and get on its hands, or the LOLA, which helps itself with its hands to walk steadily in a challenging terrain. However, simple robots with unstable structures and a minimum number of degrees of freedom can also maintain balance. Often, these devices use a mahogany. For example, we talked about a robot with a symmetrical, unstable structure and two wheels of a motorcycle: one that it drives and the other that it uses to maintain balance. Another example is self-assembled robotic cubes, which can not only maintain balance but also move independently. The Institute of Dynamic Systems and Management of the Swiss Technical University of Zurich is working on this project. They first created a robotic sculpture called The Balancing Cube that could balance on any of its edges. It was made up of independent modules and worked by exchanging information between them. Then they introduced Cubli, who was able to not only balance, including on a sloping plane, but also move in a given direction. Inside it were three rotary motors, the required rotational speeds of which were calculated automatically based on the position of the cube in space. Now a team of engineers from the same institute, led by Matthias Hofer, decided to go further. They've created a new version of Cubli that, like its predecessor, can balance at a single point. However, for this it uses only one mahogany  for alignment both on the tangage (on the transverse axis), and on the crane (on the longitudinal axis). As with its predecessor, the inertial sensors from its housing provide information about the position of the cube in space to the electric motor that regulates the speed of the rotor. The reaction moment acts on the structure's hull and stabilizes the system. However, the new robot has two degrees of freedom (a rotation around the vertical axis is not due to friction) and only one mahogany. So it keeps the balance by the difference in momentum. For this purpose , along the long axis of the new Cubli body , a balancer (a transition with straighteners) was placed . This design made the difference in moment of inertia between the two axes maximum and increased it along the axis of the crane. The locomotive must rotate faster to compensate for the tang, and the cran slower. The cube microcontroller uses this property and stabilizes both directions simultaneously, calculating the torque required for the electric motor to maintain balance. Experiments have shown that the system works  when the cube is removed from equilibrium it recovers. However, in the video demonstration, he compensated for only a very weak touch. According to the engineers, the development has the potential to be used in space, specifically in satellite navigation. Many of them are kept in the right position by the Mahomes. So, Cubli can be an example of managing elongated-shaped satellites in case they're multiple rejections. We talked about a robot that also has a reverse pendulum design and can move in any direction. However, to maintain balance, he uses another technology  two pairs of Elon's wheels, which allows him to move in any direction without turning the wheels."

    "translated_text": "Astronomers, using a machine learning algorithm and a catalog of observational data from sky surveys, have discovered 116,000 new variable stars that can be divided into seven types. The most common of these were the half-correct and rotating variable stars. The print is available on arXiv. The first is the Internet. The study of variable stars is very important for astronomy, as it allows solving many astrophysical problems, especially those that require knowledge of distances in space, star structures, and star population parameters. By observing the pulses of a star, you can determine its physical properties, such as its mass, radius, brightness, rotational speed, or distance from it. In particular, shield delta-type variables help in astrosysmological research, the eclipsed binary systems  accurately measure the mass and radius of stars, the RR-type variables of the Lira  determine the parameters of the inner halo and the thick disk of the Milky Way, as well as the properties of other galaxies, and the cepheids (or even mirids)  determine the distances to the galaxies in which they are located. A team of astronomers led by Colin Christy of Ohio State University has published a catalog of all-sky variable stars discovered during the analysis of the glow curves obtained by deep observations using the g-filter of the ASAS-SN (The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae) network of ground-based automated telescopes using a classifier using the \"random forest\" algorithm trained on the photometric data of the Gaia EDR3, 2MASS and AllWISE catalogs. In the first stage, 1.48 million candidates for variable stars were selected from 54.8 million isolated stars with a brightness of less than 18 star sizes, which were subsequently re-analysed by an updated classifier trained on the data of the Citizen ASAS-SN civil science project. The final sample contains 378,861 variable stars, of which 262,834 are already known variables, and 116,027 are new. They are divided into seven categories: eclipses, scents, cephas, liris, shield delta-type variables, semicircular and rotational variables. The stars of the last two classes made up most of the newly discovered variables. The scientists intend to use the sample to further train the classifier and to use it in civil science projects to study variable stars.

    "translated_title": "The long non-coding FEDORA RNA was linked to depression in women .",
    "translated_text": "American researchers have found that FEDORA's dna, which is expressed primarily in the prefrontal cortex and some areas of the limbic system and is associated with gender differences, causes changes in behavior associated with depression, but only in women. The results of the tests on mice and humans are published in Science Advances. According to the World Health Organization, women are twice as likely to suffer from depression as men. The molecular mechanism of these differences is not fully understood, but some studies indicate a link between long non-coding RNAs (dnkRNAs)  RNAs with lengths of more than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into proteins  with sex differences and symptoms of depression. This means that some of these dnkRNAs are more common in women and others are more common in men. In depression, their expression levels change, which can be used for clinical purposes. Researchers in the United States, led by Erik Nestler of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, decided to study molecular processes associated with the difference in the manifestation of major depressive disorder in men and women. In a post-metrical study of brain tissue in the prefrontal cortex and some areas of the limbic system, the authors found a decrease in gender differences in dnaRNA: 65.9 percent of the 762 basic gender differences in dnaRNA in healthy people were absent in people with depression. The researchers then identified dncRNAs that fit the following criteria: their concentration depends on gender, but these differences disappear when there is depression, they correlate with the level of at least one coding RNA, they are present in large numbers in the brain, and it changes with depression. These criteria were met by the anti-sense RNA RP11-298D21. 1, which the authors called FEDORA. In the brains of healthy people, it is expressed in smaller numbers in women than in men (p = 0,0261 in intersex comparisons), and in the brains of people with depression, its expression is increased in women (p = 0,0409 in healthy women), but not in men. FEDORA is expressed primarily in human oligodendrocytes and neurons and is linked to the CDH13 gene, which encodes T-cadgerin. To test the role of this dNC in the development of depression, the researchers humanized mice. They expressed FEDORA along with the green fluorescent protein in the neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex of mice using the herpes simplex virus. The control group of mice only got a green fluorescent protein. The female mice in the experimental group had higher rates of depression and anxiety than the control group: longer delay before eating after fasting (p = 0,0456), more buried balls (p = 0,0326), more time without movement in the swimming test (p = 0,0228). The authors found no difference in test scores in male subjects, which confirms the gender specificity of FEDORA expression in the medial prefrontal cortex. The authors then repeated the procedure, but now expressed FEDORA in medial prefrontal cortex oligodendrocytes using a modified adenoassociated virus. As in the previous experiment, the female individuals in the experimental group differed in behavior, but only in one test  they remained motionless longer in the swimming test (p = 0,0401). In addition, the authors found that FEDORA expression reduced myelin thickness in mice of both sexes (p &gt; 0.008), which is also the case with depression. In the final phase of the study, the authors tested whether the level of FEDORA in the blood could be used to determine depression in women. For this purpose, healthy participants and participants with resistant depression were collected blood before and after the introduction of ketamine, a rapidly acting antidepressant. Analysis showed that before ketamine was introduced, the level of FEDORA expression in women with depression was higher (p = 0.0089), while there was no such difference in men. Ketamine did not affect the normalization of FEDORA expression levels, however, the researchers found a correlation between a change in FEDORA expression levels before and after ketamine administration with a change in the manifestation of depression symptoms in women (p = 0,0377). So the authors showed that dnkRNA expression can regulate depression in women, and measuring their levels can help diagnose depression in women by blood tests. We've talked about other factors that are associated with depression before. For example, a meta-analysis of scientists from Denmark helped to detect elevated levels of protein and cortisol in the liquor of people with depression, and British researchers found that such patients had a violation of the integrity of the white matter."

    "translated_text": "In the Chinese city of Guangzhou, a 800-meter test branch of a permanent magnet-powered pendulum train has been completed, CGTN reports. Maglev is a train that does not touch the surface of a railway, but levitates over it due to the interaction of powerful magnets in the train itself and the railway. Due to the lack of contact with the tracks, such trains experience only aerodynamic resistance (although there are designs with a track in a vacuum tube that allows it to be reduced to almost zero) and are capable of traveling at enormous speeds. For example, last year in China, the first train capable of speeding up to 600 kilometers per hour was taken off the train. There are various schemes for organizing the maglev, mainly to a train floating above the rail, and electromagnetic devices for levitation and dispersion. The new train, built in Xingu County, Gansu Province, Jiangxi, differs from a typical train by moving underneath the rail rather than over it, and by using permanent magnets to hold it in the air, so the system does not use energy to levitate in a stationary position. It uses electromagnetic fields that change polarity, just like other magels. The train consists of one carriage with two sections connected by a \"hormoush\". It is designed for 88 passengers and has a top speed of 80 kilometers per hour. As it is the first such maglev, it is used for testing purposes and the route length is only 800 metres, but it is planned to be increased in the future. Magnetic levitation is a well-known and proven method of levitation, but not the only one. We have discussed this and other methods in more detail in the article \"Mogulans' Levitation\".

    "translated_text": "Astronomers have for the first time reliably identified the sub-season variability of Neptune's stratosphere  in this they have been helped by data from 17-year observations of the ice giant using ground and space telescopes. It turned out that during half of the Neptune summer, the planet's stratosphere at medium and moderate latitudes was gradually cooling, and the south pole has warmed dramatically over the past three years. The print is available on arXiv. The first is the Internet. Neptune is the most distant planet from the Sun, but it has an extremely dynamic atmosphere with strong zone winds, and a noticeable evolution of meteorological phenomena such as high-altitude clouds can last for several days. In addition, changes in Neptune's albedo, as well as long-lived clouds and dark vortices, can be observed over several years. At the same time, Neptune's year lasts 165 Earth years, which, according to the theory, will cause a slow fluctuation in temperature and in the stratosphere's chemical composition over several decades. Scientists have little information about the radiation processes and temperature dynamics and the chemical composition of the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere of Neptune. This requires high-precision observations of the average infrared wavelength, which is complicated by the ice giant's low temperature and distance from Earth. A group of astronomers led by Michael Roman of the University of Leicester in the UK published the results of an analysis of Neptune observations in the mid-infrared range from 2003 to 2020 using the VISIR instrument (VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid-InfraRed), installed on the VLT ground-complex telescope, the Spitzer space telescope and the Subaru, Keca, Gemini-North and Gemini-South ground-based telescopes. The goal of the work was to identify long-term and seasonal temperature fluctuations and the chemical composition of Neptune's atmosphere. In 2005, summer came in the southern hemisphere of Neptune, but between 2003 and 2018, the average stratospheric temperature dropped, which affected the intensity of molecular hydrogen, methane, ethan and deteriorated methane (CH3D) radiation. The meridional temperature contrast between the more southern pole and the equator has increased from about 8 kelvins in 2003 to 28 kelvins in 2020. In the period from 2018 to 2020, there was a sharp warming of the stratosphere near the south pole of Neptune. This was manifested as an increase in the brightness of the southern polar region, while the planet's mid- and low-latitudes remained more dimmer than in previous years of observations. Scientists have concluded that they have the most compelling evidence to date that Neptune is the site of processes that produce sub-seasonal atmospheric variability on both a global and regional scale. The physical mechanism of binding stratospheric temperatures, tropospheric clouds and fogs at different heights is still unknown, but may be related to seasonal changes, weather changes, or variations in solar radiation flow. We've talked about how a three-layer model of smoke explained the difference in the color of Uranus and Neptune. Alexander Voytyk"

    "translated_title": "Physicists saw killer waves in a pool with standing waves.",
    "translated_text": "Physicists have theoretically and experimentally investigated the emergence of peregrinous solitons in standing waves on the surface of water. To do this, physicists launched waves in a long pool, one of the walls of which worked as a reflecting mirror. The results suggest that ocean killer waves can be produced by nonlinear effects of interacting waves. The study was published in Physical Review Letters. Wave phenomena are universal and occur in most areas of physics. So scientists study them primarily mathematically, tailoring their solutions to a particular field: mechanics, hydrodynamics, optics, or acoustics. The situation is particularly interesting when the addition of a set of individual waves can be synergistically amplified by multiple interference. This usually results in short-lived waves with an abnormally large amplitude. In ocean physics, such waves are called killer waves and are studied thoroughly both theoretically and experimentally because of their dangers to shipping and coastal industry. However, interference of several waves is not the only possible mechanism for the formation of killer waves. Mathematicians have long known that in nonlinear conditions, waves can form solitons, that is, self-sustaining wave packs, behaving like particles. By solving the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equation, Howell Peregrine in 1983 found an analytical solution that describes a soliton (Peregrine's briser) as having a very similar property to a killer wave: it has a large amplitude, appears for a short time, and then disappears. Nonlinear approaches to this problem, however, are usually limited to one-way narrowband waves. To expand it, a group of physicists from Australia, Russia and Japan, led by Alexey Slunyaev of the Higher School of Economics, theoretically and experimentally investigated nonlinear focusing in the counterwave system. In nature, this can happen, for example, when the direction of the sea current is opposite to the direction of the wind. In particular, their misdirection is responsible for the formation of \"square\" sea waves. By boiling water in a long pool with a reflective end, scientists showed that the standing peregrine soliton that is born in this way is well described using the Schrödinger system of connected nonlinear equations. The pool used in the experiment was a 30-meter-wide reservoir of one meter, filled with water up to 0.75 meters. Physicists had only one piston wave generator installed at one end of the tank, so they used a wall at the other end as a reflecting mirror to create standing waves. The researchers were also limited to only eight wavelength sensors, but the high degree of repetition of the experiment allowed them to achieve a good spatial resolution by installing them in different places with each iteration. Because physicists were interested in the interaction of the peregrine solid with the opposite regular wave, they would start a normal wave before generating it and wait for its reflection to return. Using the boundary conditions for the Peregrine breeder, previously found by their colleagues, the authors launched its long version and looked at the outcome of the interaction. It was a soliton expressed by modulating the standing oscillations that spread along the pool. The scientists selected the boundary conditions so that the maximum modulation was in the middle of the pool. They compared the measurement results in 184 iterations for the two brizer curvature parameters with predictions made using solutions of nonlinear equations. The comparison showed that the theory describes experimental observations very well. In both cases, the Peregrine's standing brush spreads without any signs of breaking down and amplifies closer to the center of the tank. Consistency is also found in spectral dynamics, namely in the evolution of fundamental harmonics and double harmonics, which arise from nonlinear effects. The authors supplemented their study with a numerical solution of Euler's equations, which took into account the high (up to seven) order of wave interaction. Modeling with a strong nonlinearity also reproduced the basic picture seen in the experiment. But unlike the weak nonlinear pattern, it showed slightly faster movement of increasing modulation and noticeably longer focus time. In addition, the peak of focus had little asymmetry. The authors suggest that the phenomenon they have studied can be detected in other environments, such as nonlinear currents or plasma. In addition to the killer waves that occur spontaneously in the oceans, the danger is the tsunami  waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of water. They're also studied in swimming pools. One of these studies we talked about recently. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_text": "Moderate exercise, compared with 2.5 hours of fast walking, reduces the risk of depression by 25 percent compared to lack of physical activity. This is the conclusion of an article published in JAMA Psychiatry. Scientists conducted a meta-analysis of a total sample of 1,1130 adults with depression to examine their relationship to physical activity intensity. According to WHO, social and psychological factors, as well as biological ones, influence the risk of developing depression. Severe life situations, such as unemployment or traumatic events, can lead to symptoms of depression, which in turn can lead to even greater stress and worsen the quality of life. Researchers are constantly looking for new ways to prevent depression and reduce symptoms. For example, they found that omega-3s had a positive effect on depression, and they also reduced the risk of depression in nuts. Active lifestyle has been shown to be beneficial for health and cognitive development in many studies. For example, Australian doctors found that in people with sleep deprivation, physical activity reduced the risk of death. In another study, British scientists found a direct link between physical activity in childhood and emotional regulation, which also had a positive effect on a child's academic success. The benefits of exercise are also considered in the context of mental disorders. Despite numerous studies confirming the positive impact of active activity on people's mental state, the characteristics of the relationship between depression and physical activity levels have not yet been established. A team of researchers from Australia, Brazil, the UK, Poland, Singapore and Finland, led by Matthew Pearce of Cambridge University, decided to meta-analyze articles in which patients with symptoms of severe depression and major depressive disorder reported their physical activity levels. From the 19175 articles, the authors selected those in which the sample size was more than 3,000 people, and where the authors indicated the level of physical activity of the subjects, as well as gave an assessment of the risk of developing depression. The final analysis included 15 articles with a total sample of 1911,30 people over the age of 18. The meta-analysts translated the level of physical activity shown in the articles as the number of hours per week into the scores of the limit metabolic equivalent  the metabolic equivalent of exercise (which is used to determine exercise intensity) multiplied by the number of hours per week. For comparison, the metabolic equivalent of 0.5-2.0 corresponded to a low level of exercise intensity (easy work at home), and 7.0  to a very high level of intensity. The results of the meta-analysis showed a back-and-forth curve link between physical activity levels and the degree of development of major depressive disorder or symptoms of severe depression. The biggest difference was between lack of physical activity and light exercise: adults with a score of about 4.4 - half of the WHO recommended - had an 18 percent lower risk of developing depression than those who reported no exercise. People who were normally overweight (8.8 points) had a 25 percent lower risk. No significant additional benefit was found when the load was increased above normal. The authors found that the WHO recommended dose of physical activity, equivalent to 2.5 hours of vigorous walking a week, could reduce the risk of depression by 25 percent. Previous meta-analyses have helped to determine the relationship between depression and other factors. For example, German psychologists have linked vegetarianism to depression, but a WHO study has found no link between depression and working hours. Anastasia Lyashenko"

    "translated_text": "Physicists from the LHCb collaboration reported the discovery of three exotic particles at once: a strange pentaquark, an openly charged double-charged tetraquark, and its neutral partner. The traces of the new hadrons were revealed in the decay of charged and neutral B-mesons. The new results are of high statistical significance. The discovery is reported on the LHCb collaboration website and in a CERN report. Physicists today know six quarks with different aromas: upper (u), lower (d), strange (s), charming (c), charming (b) and true (t) (the latter two are often called bot and top quarks). Together with their antiparticles, they form twelve basic elements, from which quarks form in nature. Most often, it's a three-quark baryon or two-quark antiquark pair in a meson. More complex combinations of quarks are considered exotic. And while they were predicted at the same time as the quark theory, these particles started to register relatively recently with the construction of the Large Hadron Collider. The first tetrachwark was seen by the LHCb collaboration in April 2014, and the pentaquark in 2015. We've reported on these discoveries regularly in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In sum, on the BAC. 66 new hadrons have been discovered, 59 of which are LHCb. Physicists at LHCb recently reported that they had discovered three new particles at once: one strange pentaquark, a double-charged tetraquark and its neutral partner. Pentaquark PΛψs(4338)0 has shown itself in the decay of the negatively charged B-meson B-→J/ψΛp. It's made up of charming quarks and charming antiquars, as well as upper, lower and odd quarks. This is the first pentaquark to contain a strange quark. The finding has enormous statistical significance in 15 standard deviations, which is far more than the 5 standard deviations required to make a statement about particle observation in elementary particle physics. The mass and width of the new pentaquark were equal to 4338,2±0,7±0,4 and 7,0±1,2±1,3 megaelectronvolts, respectively. Two tetraquares Tacs0(2900)++ and Tacs0(2900)0 were observed by physicists in a combined analysis of the decay of other B-mesons: B0→ D0Ds+π- and B+→D-Ds+π+. The first particle is an openly charged double-charged tetraquark, consisting of charged quarks, strange antiquars, upper quarks and lower antiquars. His neutral partner is different from him in the last two quarks: the upper antiquark and the lower quarks. The new tetra quarks observed with statistical significance of 6.5 and 8 standard deviations are the first case of a pair of tetra quarks. The mass and width of both tetraquarks are defined as 2,908±0,011±0,02 and 0,136±0,023±0,011 gigaelectronvolts, respectively. At the moment, physicists are debating the interpretation of tetra and pentaquark. Some believe they are closely related to the quark system, while others suggest that exotic particles  are analogues to molecules consisting of individual baryons or mesons. Perhaps the exact answer to this question will come from the third season of Big Hadron Collider. It's just recently started the first proton collisions at 13.6 tera-electronvolts. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_text": "The European Space Agency (ESA) has found a replacement for the Soyuz-ST rocket, which was previously planned to be used to launch the Euclid telescope into space, but the launch was not possible due to the suspension of Soyuz launches by Russia. The telescope will now be launched with SpaceX's Falcon 9 carrier rocket, Spacenews reports. I'm not going to. The development of Euclid began in 2012, and the useful load of the observatory consists of the 1.2-meter Korsh telescope and scientific instruments VIS (VISible imager) and NISP (Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer). The telescope will explore dark energy and dark matter, determine the rate of expansion of the universe, and help create a three-dimensional map of the distribution of galaxies in the universe. The cryogenic test of the telescope was successfully completed at the end of last year, and it is now assembled at Thales Alenia Space in Turin, where it is preparing for thermal vacuum testing. Initially, the launch of Euclid from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana was scheduled for the end of this year, with the launch of the Soyuz ST-A carrier rocket. However, in February of this year, Roscosmos suspended cooperation with European partners to organize commercial launches of the Soyuz-ST carrier missile in response to EU sanctions. This caused ESA to look for another carrier rocket, while also having difficulty starting operations of its new Ariane 6 rocket. As a result, the agency has chosen the Falcon 9 rocket-carrier of the American private company SpaceX, now scheduled for launch in 2023. The ESA did not disclose the cost of the transfer, including the loss of funds due to the collapse of the commercial launch on the Union. After launching into space, the observatory will begin a 30-day flight to Lagrange's second point in the Solar System, around which it will operate in a halo-orbit for six years. In addition to the Euclid, the Falcon 9 was selected to launch another mission  three Hera spacecraft, which are now being built by ESA. They'll be launched in 2024 and will go to investigate the asteroid Dimorph, which was previously hit by the DART probe."

    "translated_title": "The new DIANA fMRT method tracked the neural activity of mice with an accuracy of up to five milliseconds.",
    "translated_text": "Korean engineers have developed a new method for functional magnetic resonance imaging that allows direct visualization of brain neuronal activity with accuracy of up to five milliseconds, while maintaining a high spatial resolution of 0.22 millimeters. A description of the new approach, which the authors called DIANA, is published in Science. Modern science uses many methods to study the brain activity of animals and humans, but each method has its limitations. For example, electroencephalography allows you to measure electrical waves by recording the voltage fluctuations that depend on ionic current in neurons. Although this method has a good temporary resolution, the recording of the electroencephalography can be severely distorted due to physical and physiological interference (surrounding tissues or movement). And functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is a way to visualize brain activity, gives you a more accurate picture of what's going on inside the brain, but it's basically not working directly, so the magnetic field of the MRI is recording changes in blood flow when the brain structures are activated, so you can only know the response to a stimulus seconds after it's triggered. Although fMRI remains one of the most popular non-invasive techniques for visualizing brain activity, using an indirect pathway to set parameters has a strong impact on the accuracy of the results of experiments. So scientists are constantly looking for ways to improve their research methods. A team of Korean engineers, led by Phant Tan Toi of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Songjungwan University, has developed a fMRT method that can directly record neuronal activity. The main advantage of the new imaging method, which the authors have called DIANA (direct imaging of neuronal activity), is that it allows the spatial accuracy (resolution) of the functional MRI method to be maintained while increasing the time resolution: DIANA can dynamically visualize neuron pulses with accuracy up to milliseconds using the \"2D fast line-scan\" approach. The new method was tested on mice in a Tesla 9.4 MRI scanner. The focus for visualization was the area of one millimeter of the primary somatosensory cortex. In the scan, the researchers gave a five-hertz and 0.5 millisecond electrical impulse to the muzzle cushions of the mules that were under anesthesia every 200 milliseconds. The results showed that electrical stimulation provoked a significant increase in the signal in the counterlateral primary somatosensory cortex, compared to the signal level before the stimulus appeared (p &lt;0.001). The peak delay of the DIANA signal increase was 25 milliseconds from the moment of stimulation. The authors did not find this effect in mice that did not receive electrical stimulation, nor in dead mice. Also, when the authors visualized a neural response to the stimulation of the mucous membranes of the jaws passing through the thalamus into the primary somatosensory cortex, a conventional fMRT method, which relies on changes in blood flow, showed parallel activation of the thalamus and primary somatosensory cortex due to poor temporal resolution, while the DIANA signal showed significant structural activation sequentially. The authors have thus shown that the new method has an improved time resolution of five milliseconds and a spatial resolution of 0.22 millimetres. The researchers note that DIANA can make a major contribution to the study of the functional organization of the brain, including neural networks. We wrote about the techniques of neuroimaging in \"The Bright Inner World\"."

    "translated_title": "Physicists figured out how to slowly lower the covers of boxes from table games and gadgets .",
    "translated_text": "Danish physicists have studied in detail why the lids on the boxes from under the table games or home electronics are so slowly falling. It turns out that in this case, there could be three different types of hydrodynamic resistance between the lid and the box. The experiments with the purchase boxes and 3D printing rods were in excellent agreement with the theory. The study was published in Physical Review Fluids. Cardboard boxes were first used as packaging materials in the late 19th century. Although the cardboard itself is relatively brittle, the hardness of the ribs makes it possible to make a fairly durable frame. The low weight, low cost, and simplicity of manufacture have made cardboard one of the most popular packaging materials. One way to pack cardboard was by telescopic packaging, which means that the box is closed by a closely-containing lid. The size of the lid is important: if it is too large, the gap between the lid and the walls of the box will cause it to chatter. Too close to the walls and the lid makes it difficult to open and close the boxes. Experimentally, the technology has been designed to have a thin air layer of about a millimeter thick. It prevents the box from opening too quickly by partially sealing. This ensures high reliability of such packaging even without the use of adhesive materials. For this reason, telescopic packaging is often used in the sale of home electronics and table games. The aerodynamic effects of the thin layer are also evident when the lid needs to be closed: under certain conditions it descends very slowly and at a nearly constant speed. Despite a good understanding of the processes involved, physicists have never studied them in detail. To correct this misunderstanding, a team of physicists at the Technical University of Denmark, led by Kaare Jensen, carefully investigated how many boxes of table games and electronics are closed. By capturing 13 different boxes in 32 experiments, they built a dependence of the vertical coordinates of the cover on time. It turns out that all the results were divided into three groups. In the first case, the cover drops at a constant speed, in the second, it slows down (the height is determined by the square root of time), in the third, the cover drops down at the beginning, and then slowly reaches the end. Their theoretical analysis of the observed physics began with the assumption that the air flow through the gap between the lid and the box is equal to the ratio of the pressure difference created by the lid to the hydrodynamic resistance of the gap. On the other hand, if the cover goes down parallel to the box, the same flow is determined by the area of the cover multiplied by its speed. So the key to interpreting the results of the experiment was to define resistance correctly. In the simplest case, when the side walls of the cover are parallel to the walls of the box, you can use Pozzoil's theory for Reynolds-low flows (physicians estimated it for boxes as not exceeding 50). The solution to the differential equation showed that the position of the cover depends on time according to the square root law. Therefore, to explain the other two types of dependence, it is necessary to abandon the requirement of parallel walls. The authors took this into account with a slight slope. In other words, the lid can be both narrowing and expanding. Both cases complicated the hydrodynamic resistance of the crack, but it allowed us to learn that for the narrowing book of the cover its coordinates depend on time by linear law, and for the expanding  by reverse, in good agreement with the results of experiments. The qualitative results of the calculation can be understood as follows. For parallel walls, the resistance increases evenly as the cover descends, so its slowdown is smooth (square root). When there is a contraction, it makes a major contribution to the hydrodynamic resistance. For a narrowing ledge, the cover is always narrowing, so its speed is about constant. Otherwise, the contraction only appears at the end of the fall, so the lid brakes sharply. The experience with the shopping cart was so disadvantaged that it was impossible to control the angle of inclination. So physicists repeated their experiments under more controlled conditions. In a new version of the experience, a 3D printer's rod with a different slope of the walls fell into a plexiglass cylinder filled with water. The results showed good agreement with the theory. They also calculated the conditions for the fastest drop of the rod. It turns out that to do that, it has to be a narrowing of the ledge, and the bulk of the gap has to be twice as large as the narrowing itself. The packaging improves year after year. We've already talked about a new version of a smart mailbox. However, the old good cardboard remains an integral part of technical progress. Cardboard parts are used in the creation of portable devices for DNA analysis and even VR helmets. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "Depressed people found more protein and cortisol in liquor.",
    "translated_text": "A meta-analysis and systematic review of 97 studies found that people with depression had higher levels of interleukin 6, a common protein, and cortisol in their spinal fluid (liquor) than healthy people. The concentration of homovaniline and gamma amino fatty acids, somatostatin, neurotrophic factor, beta-amyloid and transistyrene in the liquor of depressed patients was lower. The study was published in JAMA Psychiatry. The pathogenesis of depression has not been fully studied. There are many theories that try to explain both the onset and the manifestation of the disease. The monamine theory links the development of depression to a deficiency of the biogenic amines  serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine. It is partly confirmed by the fact that taking antidepressants that regulate the metabolism of these amines improves your condition. However, the effectiveness of these drugs varies widely, and other mechanisms appear to play a role in the development of depression. It was suggested that depression was associated with imbalances in the glutamate system and gamma-aminosaturated acid (GAMC) system, hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-hypofysal-nephrine axis, inflammation and decreased neuroplasticity. Understanding the pathogenesis will help us develop effective treatments for depression. Michael Eriksen Benros and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that looked at the biochemical composition of liquor in depressed patients (not including bipolar patients) and healthy people, as spinal fluid reflects current biochemical changes in the brain, and it is readily available for research. A total of 97 studies contained the necessary data for meta-analysis. In total, 165 biomarkers were studied in these studies, but only 42 were quantified in two or more studies. The level of homovaniline acid in the liquor of depressed patients was lower than in healthy people (17 studies, 684 patients and 681 control group members). Also, there was a decrease in gamma-aminosulfuric acid (four studies, 180 patients and 111 people in the control group). The levels of 5-hydroxyindolactic acid, 3-methyxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, glutamate and glutamine were not significantly different between the groups. The severity of depression, measured using the Hamilton scale, positively affected the levels of 5-hydroxyindolactic acid (p = 0,04) and 3-methyxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (p &lt; 0,001) in the spinal fluid. However, with the exception of two articles, this dependence has ceased to be statistically significant. Scientists found that depressed patients had elevated cortisol levels in the liquor (two studies, 77 patients and 81 people in the control group). At the same time, transurethrin levels were lower in people with depression than in healthy people. (two studies, 25 patients and 39 healthy ones). Also, the meta-analysis found lower somatostatin levels in patients with depression (five studies, 130 patients and 113 healthy people). The two groups did not find significant differences in the concentrations of corticotropin-rising factor, adrenal corticotropin hormone, oxytocin, and vasopressin. There was also no difference in levels of Y-neuropeptide, P-substance, oerexins, amino acids, and metabolites. In contrast, people with depression had more interleukin 6 (seven studies, 156 patients and 229 healthy) and protein in the liqueur (five studies, 220 patients and 261 people in the control group). The levels of interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor α, leukocytes, and matrix metaloproteinase-3 remained similar in both groups. The albumin-glucose ratio also did not differ significantly between the groups. Among the markers of synaptic plasticity, the levels of brain neurotrophic factor were lower in patients with depression (three studies, 46 patients and 62 healthy), while the levels of nerve cell adhesion molecules were not significantly different. At the same time, the scientists found lower levels of beta-amyloid 40  marker of neurodegeneration (three studies, 71 patients and 81 people in the control group). No difference in levels of tau-protein, beta-amyloid 42, neurogrinin and fine polypeptide neurofilament was found. In single studies, patients with depression in the liquor had elevated levels of asparagine, a B-cell activating factor, the fifth component of the complement, corticosteroid, fibrinogen, hyaluronic acid, beta-interferon, matrix metaloproteinase-2 and 10, noradrenaline, quinoline acid, D-dimer, sorbitol, and treonine. Also in several studies, levels of beta-amyloid 38, butyrylcholinesterase, calcitonin, carnosine, ethanolamine, type four monocyte chemotoxic protein, spiral tau-filaments, picolinic acid, dissolved beta-amyloid precursor protein, and dissolved myeloid cell receptor were lower in people with depression compared to control samples. The type of treatment (stable or outpatient) and discontinuation of medication before taking a sample of the liquor were not significantly linked to biomarker levels. Overall, this systematic review and meta-analysis shows that several brain structures may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression, which can be damaged in different ways. However, many studies used small groups, and most of them identified only a few biomarkers, making it difficult to fully study their relationship to specific depressive phenotypes. Scientists around the world are working on new drugs to alleviate symptoms of depression, as existing drugs are not doing their job. We recently told you that antidepressants don't have a significant impact on the quality of life that's associated with health. However, in this study, it's not all that clear. The Glory of Gomenuk"

    "translated_title": "The carbon belt is wrapped in a Mebius tape .",
    "translated_text": "Chemists in Japan have produced a molecule in the form of a belt wrapped in a Mebius strip with a completely coupled bonding system. Experiments with YMRI spectroscopy and computer calculations have shown that a molecule can twist along the entire length of a carbon frame. The study was published in Nature Synthesis. Chemists like to make molecules of strange shape, like molecular nodes with multiple cross-sections or nanotubes made of aromatic carbon fragments. One of the most difficult tasks in this field is getting molecules wrapped in a Mebius strip. The first time this molecule was synthesized was in 2003, and it contained a flexible linear chain of several carbon atoms. But to date, we have not been able to obtain a molecular tape of Mebius, made up of rigid aromatic carbon cycles. Chemists led by Yasutomo Segawa of Nagoya University conducted computer calculations using the DFT method to see if they could get a carbon belt in the form of a Mebius tape. They wanted to compare how much less stable the structure of the Mebius strip is than the structure of a simple carbon belt. To do this, scientists have calculated the enthalpy of two sets of hypothetical reactions. These reactions were the final closure of a macrocycle with either a nanotubes with an even number of nodes or a Mebius strip with an odd number of nodes. According to the results of the calculations, as the chemists thought, the structure of the belts was much less tense. However, as the number of joints increased, the structure became less tense with the twisting, so the chemists decided to try to get a long molecular strip of Mebius with 50 associated aromatic rings. Chemists began synthesis with dibromphenanthate, modified by the butoxy groups for greater solubility. They put it in the formation reaction, and then into the chlormethylation reaction. The result was an aldehyde group at one end of the molecule, and a chlorine atom at the other that could replace itself under the action of nucleophiles. Chlorine chemists replaced phosphine and thus obtained the source for the key Wittig reaction, in which an aldehyde group reacts with phosphonium salt in the presence of a base to form a double bond. This sequence of reactions, repeated several times by chemists, ended in macrocyclization with the formation of a long cyclic molecule containing many double bonds. To turn it into a fully coupled belt in the form of a Mebius strip, chemists reacted the combination with a nickel complex. And they got the right product with a 20 percent yield. To confirm the structure of the product, chemists used mass spectrometry. They found that the molar mass of the product was the same as the calculated. And I.M.R. spectroscopy helped confirm the presence of twisting in the molecule. And the chemists only got clear signals in the YMR spectrum when the solution was heated to 140 degrees Celsius. They suggested that this was due to the rapid movement of the twisted fragment across the molecule, and, as a result, the averaging of signals from different nuclei in the YMRI spectrum. Because the final stage of synthesis could be twisted in two ways, chemists obtained the product as a mixture of two mirror isomers. And they decided to divide them using chiral fluid chromatography. As a result, they were able to identify two mirror isomers and confirm their structure using a circular dichroism spectroscopy. As a result, chemists have produced a molecular tape of Mebius, consisting of rigid aromatic carbon cycles. They confirmed the presence of the twisting by YMRI spectroscopy and were able to separate the two mirror isomers of the product. The authors of the paper believe that the synthesis was successful thanks to computer calculations. The Mebius strip is easier to obtain if you insert flexible and mobile heterocyclic fragments into the molecule. One such successful synthesis we talked about recently. Michael Boim"

This tool can be used to manipulate even single atoms. Read about the design of optical pinsets and why they won the Nobel Prize in physics in the journal Scalpel and the Pincet. The ability to capture atoms with a laser paved the way for quantum computation using atomic arrays. We've been talking about the role of optical pins in these devices in detail with the example of a 51-cubic-inch computer built by scientists in Russia and the United States. A laser tool is not only able to hold atoms in place, but it can move them around the array. If you move atoms from place to place in an array, you can lose it, especially if the pincet path is blocking other pincet or atoms. You can see for yourself with the mobile game Quantum Moves, which we've talked about. The game recently released a sequel that you can run directly from the browser. Jaewook Ahn of the Korea Institute of Advanced Technology and his colleagues from Korea and Japan looked at the problem from a different perspective. They suggested that the quality of nuclear transport could be improved by moving them in free flight. To do this, physicists have developed a protocol for the optical pincet, which throws the atom at the beginning and catches it at the end of the path. The idea behind the method is that after the atom is disintegrated, the pincet should shut off and switch on in the right place and time at the start of braking. In simple approximation, an atom oscillating in an optical pincet trap is like a ball, without friction, rolling in a round cup with low edges. If you accelerate too fast, the ball will go overboard and get lost. The same goes for catching it slowly. A number of parameters are important, including the ball's oscillation phase. By solving the corresponding equations together for all three stages, the authors have determined the limits and optimal parameters for throwing and catching an atom into an optical pincet. To test them, physicists conducted an experiment with rubidium atoms cooled to 40 microkelvin. The experimental setup was similar to those used in most experiments to hold atoms with optical pinsets, except for the acoustic optical modulator, as well as the two-dimensional optical modulator in Fourier plane. To visualize the movement of atoms, physicists photographed their fluorescence. Scientists constructed a 12.6 micrometre success rate dependence on the acceleration and braking achieved and compared it to theoretical calculations. The experiment was in good agreement with the modeling, and the maximum achievable success rate was 94±3 percent. The authors compared the success of free movement to the movement of an unturned pincet. The second was more effective when there were no obstacles to the atomic path. But when another pincet interfered with the movement of the atom, its passage through the center of the barrier was almost undistorted. Physicists have also demonstrated that their technique, faster and more successful than traditional methods based on pincet movement, allows for the \"repair\" of atomic masses, one of which is empty due to loss. In addition to mass correction, the new method paves the way for dynamic quantum computing architectures, where configuration changes are free of decogeneration caused by laser pincet radiation. Freely flying atoms have recently become very interesting to physicists as a tool for creating atomic interferometers. These precise devices can sense the slightest change in the conditions under which atoms fly. For example, we told you how an atomic interferometer saw an underground tunnel in urban conditions."

The cause was the incoming air through the unknown The mechanism under the skin, into the pleural cavity, the median and the pelvis from which it is made He was walking out through an open wound after a failed operation. The report was published in the American Journal of Case Reports. Under certain conditions Air can get into parts of the body that are not suitable for it, such as soft tissue (this is called an emphysema with the affected area indicated) or grayish cavities (these conditions are called \"pneumatic\" attachments, for example, Pneumothorax in the pleural cavity, Pneumoperiotoneum in the abdomen, with pneumomediastine in the middle, The pneumoscrotum is in the scrotum .

    "translated_text": "At the age of 68 the Soviet and Russian theoretical physicist, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Valery Rubakov, who actively studied the issues of cosmology, quantum gravity and high energy physics, died. It happened on October 19, 2022. The death of the scientist was reported by the press secretary of the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, where Rubakov worked. The scientist was born in Moscow in 1955. In 1978 he graduated from the physics faculty of the Moscow State University and then entered the postgraduate program of the Institute of Nuclear Research of the USSR. The subject of the dissertation, which Rubakov defended in 1981 under the leadership of Krasnikov and Tavheleidze, was \"Vacuum structure in calibration models of quantum field theory\". He became a doctor of science in 1989. Physics has over 160 scientific papers. His areas of interest were cosmology and early universe theory, non-perturbable methods in quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and models with additional spatial dimensions. Rubakov was one of the founders of modern inflation theory. He studied the origin of gravitational waves, as well as the preservation of baryon and lepton numbers in the expanding universe. Rubakov actively studied quantum effects that occur when space topology changes. He was interested in how the constants of communication and coherence behave in the formation and separation of the \"daughter\" universes. These studies were aimed at solving the problem of cosmological constant and building a stable model of quantum gravity. Much of his career was devoted to solving the problem of unlimited growth of the cross section of the multipartite birth when high-energy particles collide, which arise when perturbative computational methods are used, i.e. a class of approaches based on decomposition into rows by the parameters of smallness. In his research, he used the concept of instants, that is, time-localized decisions that involve imaginary time. The semiclassical approach developed by physicists allowed the theory to be built in which the growth of the sections was suppressed, as well as to make predictions for the range of energies reached in the foreseeable future. Since 2016, the physicist has been the editor of the journal \"Successes of Physical Sciences\", and also belongs to the editorial board of the journal \"Theoretical and Mathematical Physics\". His fruitful work was recognized with numerous awards and medals, including the Gold Medal with a prize for young scientists of the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Julius Vess Prize from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and many others. You can read more about the early universe in the article \"The Universe Instead of Nothing\", for which Valery Rubakov wrote a commentary."

    "translated_title": "The glass strips will help control the friction of the styles.",
    "translated_text": "Japanese physicists experimentally investigated how the structure of a glass surface at millimeter and nanometer levels affects friction between it and various materials. Their research will help improve handwriting systems for tablets and phones in the future. The work was published in Scientific Reports. Tensions are complex types of interactions between macroscopic bodies, as they can be caused by various causes: mechanical, physical, chemical, and so on. Tribologists, or scientists studying friction, identify different types of friction that work at different scales. For example, in deformational friction, the energy of motion is spent on changing the macroscopic structure, while the forces of adhesion prevent sliding at the microscopic level. Friction management plays a vital role in many areas of human activity. If the friction is desirable to reduce to reduce the wear of machinery parts, increasing it is important for efficient braking and energy efficiency. Control of tribological properties is important even when designing handwriting devices for touch-based tablets and phones. Although texturing the glass surface could help control friction better, there is little research on this. One of the groups that addressed this problem was a team of Japanese physicists led by Naoki Fujita of Nippon Electric Glass, a display glass manufacturer. They've previously experimentally found that the sheer roughness of glass at millimeter and nanometer scales allows you to control the friction coefficient of the writing tip. Now the researchers have deepened their understanding of this relationship by changing the step and the height of the depths. In their experiment, the scientists tested the backward-backward friction for two endpoints for styluses (elastomer and polyacetal) that were in contact with structured glass surfaces. The ends had radii of curvature equal to 687 and 665 micrometers, respectively. In addition, the elastomer had a striped structure, so its surface roughness was an order of magnitude higher than that of the polyathellar endpoint (10.5 micrometers versus 0.7 micrometers). The glass plates used in the experiment had dimensions of 70×70×0.55 millimeters. Physicists have structured them by spraying a suspension of aluminum oxide microparticles (average diameter 1.2 micrometers) from distilled water. Different textures were obtained by controlling the speed of the strokes and the step of the spindle. The authors characterized the resulting surfaces using a step (500, 750 and 1000 micrometers) and the depth of the forming faults (from 0 to 50 nanometers), while all the plates remained transparent. A smooth glass surface was used as a control sample. During the experiment, physicists fixed the ends at a 60 degree angle and pressed them to glass plates at a load of 0.98 and 1.96 newtons. The amplitude of the backward motion was 50 millimeters at a speed of five millimeters per second. The authors conducted up to 100 periods of motion during which the tenso-meter measured the force of friction, from which the friction coefficient was then derived. Physicists constructed the dependencies of this coefficient on the depth of texture by averaging 5 and 95 cycles for various endpoints and surfaces. The materials of the finches behaved differently when textures were present. So the structure reduced friction for the elastomer and increased friction for the polyacetal, although in the second case the friction was almost not dependent on depth. The graphics were well explained by a high-quality representation of the contact properties of the materials used and their dimensions. For example, physicists knew that the friction of an elastomer on the glass was caused by adhesion. Structuring the surface with a step smaller than the diameter of the tip reduces the contact area. As the period grows, the tip falls deeper into the falls and the friction begins to be affected by deformation. Polyacetal, on the other hand, is a harder material with a smaller contact area (its diameter is 180 micrometers). The balance of the contact geometry with the step and depth corresponded to the dependencies seen. Scientists have supplemented their findings by studying how friction between glass and elastomer differs at different loads. It confirmed the role of deformation at the great depths of texture. Finally, physicists conducted a series of experiments with much greater depths (1463 nanometers) and slower motion, in which the contact area was captured by a digital camera. This allowed scientists to study how the contact areas fluctuate in for both types of extremities. We've been talking about how physicists have already built a microscopic model of the friction of a particle on a periodically structured surface. They found that the force of friction is very little dependent on the conversion of mechanical energy into heat. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "Archaeologists have discovered a medieval toy sword with Danish runes",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have discovered a wooden toy sword dating from the late XII  XIII century during excavations at the medieval German court in Greater Novgorod. Eight Danish runes are carved on this object, which are supposed to translate as \"a whole year\". This is only the second runic inscription found in Novgorod. This is reported in the press release of the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1932, the famous Russian scientist Artemy Artsikhovsky created the Novgorod Archaeological Expedition. In the nine decades since, researchers have explored more than 50 sites in different parts of the ancient and medieval city, covering more than 40,000 square meters. In 1951, the expedition made a major discovery in the 20th century's national archaeology. They discovered the first brass writing, which has since been found in Novgorod alone. In total, the collection of objects of material culture already contains more than 150 thousand individual finds, including the oldest known book of Rus' discovered in 2000 \"Novgorodsky psaltry\" (\"Novgorodsky codex\"). Last year, during work on the John excavation, located on the Trade side of the Great Novgorod, archaeologists discovered the likely border of the German court. In the 12th and 15th centuries it was the official representative and trading factory of German merchants until it was closed by Ivan III in 1494 for a number of reasons. Until 2021, it was not possible to determine its exact location. It was known only that it covered an area of about two thousand square meters and was located somewhere between the ancient streets of Ilina and the Great Trial. A few months ago, new discoveries were made at the site. Among them were a wooden entrance, numerous German tableware, items with family trademarks, and western European cutlery. Researchers from the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Novgorod State Museum-Reserve and the Novgorod State University under the leadership of Petr Gaidukov continued their work on the Johannes excavation. Archaeologists note the enormous density of finds on this site  up to a hundred objects are found on one ten centimeter layer of cultural layer. Among the finds was a toy wooden sword dating from the late XII  XIII century. On this pine object, the researchers discovered eight carved Danish runes, which translated supposedly means \"a whole year\". Archaeologists noted that the Hanseans usually came to Novgorod for six months. But it seems the man who left the runic inscription on the sword stayed here longer. According to the researchers, the runic inscription in Novgorod was found only once  in the distant 1958. At the time, at the Neve excavation (Sofia side), archaeologists discovered a fragment of a pig's bone, which also contained Danish runes. In a 1962 article on the find, it was dated to the XIXII centuries. In addition, runic inscriptions were found on other monuments, for example, in 2011 a four-sided pendant-amulet with runes was found in the Rurik town hall. This year, 13 breech grams were also found in Greater Novgorod, with one in the John excavation.

    "translated_title": "Rocket Lab failed to capture the first stage of the missile by helicopter",
    "translated_text": "The American company Rocket Lab was unable to capture the first stage of the Electron rocket for the second time because of the loss of telemetry. This was during the launch of the Swedish research satellite MATS. The broadcast was on Youtube. Returning the first stage of the rocket allows it to be partially reusable, reducing its operating costs and lowering launch costs. This approach is used in SpaceX rockets, where the steps return to the ground (or floating barge) with their engines, and the head rope is on parachutes. The company that created the Electron rocket went a different route to achieving reusable rocketry. The first stage of the rocket, after completion, produces a parachute, which, when the speed of the stage slows down enough, is captured by a Sikorsky S-92 helicopter and a long hooked cable, and then transported to the company's ground workshops to assess its reusable capability. In May of this year, the company first caught a rocket with a helicopter, but the tests were not entirely successful: the load on the helicopter was too high, so the pilot had to drop the ladder almost immediately after the capture. On November 4, 2022, Rocket Lab launched the Electron rocket from a spaceport on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand as part of the \"Catch Me If You Can\" mission. The scientific satellite MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) of the Swedish National Space Agency, with a launch weight of 50 kilograms, was used as a payload. It will operate in a synchronous solar orbit at an altitude of 585 kilometers, studying atmospheric waves and processes in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere. About 2.5 minutes later, the first step was complete, and a few minutes later, the parachute was unlocked. This time, the flight failed to catch a step. It was brought to the ocean, where it was later recovered by a service ship. The reason for the failure is the loss of telemetry from the first stage. Rocket Lab has previously unveiled a concept for its Neutron medium-class rocket, which will be powered by engines to return to the stage."

    "translated_title": "Apple has unveiled the iPhone 14 with a satellite distress signal",
    "translated_text": "Apple has introduced the iPhone 14 smartphone with the ability to send a satellite SOS signal, the iPhone 14 Pro with a screen cut instead of a \"checker\", and the Apple Watch Ultra with a titanium case and an additional button. The company also unveiled the new standard Apple Watch models and the second generation AirPods Pro headphones. The presentation was broadcast on Apple's YouTube channel. The standard iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models have OLED displays with a diagonal of 6.1 and 6.7 inches respectively. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max use screens of similar size, but with higher-quality matrices that support updates of 1 Hertz. This has led to the Always-On mode, where the display always shows the clock and other information, even when the screen is locked. The main difference between the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max is the design. Now the cut for the cameras and other sensors is not at the edge of the screen, but in the display itself, not far from the top edge. The developers have adapted iOS to this change. Now many notifications pop up from this cut as if it were expanding: Conventional models have the same A15 Bionic processor as the iPhone 13, and Pro versions are equipped with a more powerful A16 Bionic, made using TSMC's 4-nanometer process. The standard iPhone 14 features two updated rear cameras with a resolution of 12 megapixels and a front camera with a similar resolution. Apple used a 48-megapixel array for the main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro, but in most cases it combines data from four adjacent pixels to produce a 12-megapixel image. The other three (two rear and one front) use 12-megapixel matrices. The iPhone has learned to identify car accidents and automatically notify emergency services and human contacts of the incident. The feature works even far from civilization: the smartphone can transmit emergency messages via Globalstar satellites. To do this, the smartphone shows the user where to point the gadget so that the signal can successfully be transmitted to the device in orbit. The feature will only be available in the US and Canada from November, and will be free for the first two years. Satellite communication has been demonstrated in previous experiments and other mass-produced smartphones. All models sold in the US have received an unusual update  they will no longer have the usual SIM card slot. Instead, users will only be able to use eSIM. The iPhone 14 starts at $799, and the iPhone 14 Plus starts at $899. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are priced at $999 and $1099, respectively. They'll go on sale on September 16. The eighth generation of Apple watches has a different design, but some new features. In particular, the watch now has two sensors to measure body temperature: one right in the hand and one right behind the screen. One of the applications that Apple offers for thermometers is more accurate monitoring of menstrual cycle and ovulation. The Apple Watch Series 8 runs from a single charge for 18 hours, but they (and all models starting with the fourth generation) have an energy saving mode, where the gadget takes one charge for 36 hours. In addition to the older model, Apple introduced the new Apple Watch SE, equipped with the same processor, but inferior to the main version in other characteristics. Apple has not only introduced updates to existing models, but also the new  Apple Watch Ultra. They're aimed at sports fans, so the gadget has a stronger titanium alloy body, and an extra button to assign the right action. Ultra also got a more powerful battery that could run for 36 hours in a normal mode and 60 hours in an energy-saving mode. The company notes that the watch supports both the regular GPS channel L1 and the relatively new L5, which some satellites began broadcasting in 2014. The Apple Watch Ultra can automatically determine the depth of the dive and run a built-in or third-party dive app. It shows useful data for divers, like, tracking the speed of the tide. The Apple Watch Series 8 is priced from $399 for the standard version and $499 for the mobile version, and the second-generation Apple Watch SE starts at $249 and $299, respectively. Ultra is a lot more expensive, starting at $799. The sale of the regular watch will begin on September 16 and the Ultra will begin on September 23. The company has introduced the second generation AirPods Pro. The design has remained the same as the previous model, but the headphones have a new way of controlling the device: a touch panel on the legs that supports gestures. One charge of the AirPods Pro lasts up to 6 hours, and the case adds 30 hours of listening. It's got a belt attachment and a speaker to signal the start of the charge and other events. The price of the headphones is $249, and sales will begin on September 23. Apple's previous big presentation was in early June. The company has introduced new versions of its operating systems, as well as new MacBook laptops. Grigory Kopiyev"

    "translated_title": "The lone wasps ate their own brothers and sisters",
    "translated_text": "The larvae of the solitary roaring isodontia harmandi were cannibals. If the fox has too little game in its nest or laid too many eggs, its young begin to eat the brothers and sisters. As a result, the number of extracts is reduced by about half, which allows for food shortages. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal PLoS ONE. Some animals produce more offspring than they can feed. This problem is solved by a mechanism known as the reduction of output. For example, parents may eat some eggs or cubs (see our article \"Chewing and Not Getting Worried\"). In other cases, young individuals compete fiercely with each other, causing the weakest to starve to death or to be killed by their brothers and sisters. Also, sometimes older cubs eat younger sibling. This is particularly true of owls in years when the catch is low. Similar examples are known in amphibians and insects. The larvae of the single bee and the bear from the same nest rarely compete with each other (in this case, it is the representatives of the group of the plighting ones (Aculeata); among the rider larvae, which are also sometimes called the oas, competition and cannibalism is a common occurrence). The reason is that each larva usually develops in an individual cell with a personal supply of food. Also, all the young in the nest are about the same age, so none of them have the opportunity to get out of their eggs early and eat their brothers and sisters. Cannibalism in the larvae of these insects occurs only in rare cases when the individual cell walls are destroyed and neighbors face to face. However, the solitary isodontia harmandi, a member of the roaring family (Sphecidae), does not obey this rule. The females of these insects build a nest that has no individual cells, fill it with prey and lay up to eleven eggs inside. On average, there are 5.4 eggs in one nest and 37,142.3 victims. All larvae from one nest develop in common space. And in each nest I. Harmandi are young individuals of only one sex  or only males, or only females. Scientists once assumed that the larvae I. Harmandi coexist peacefully in the nest, and the reported cases of suspected cannibalism in these oases were considered a rare anomaly. However, as evidence of such behavior grew, experts changed their minds and began to assume that the larvae I. The harmandi eat each other regularly. However, this issue has not been systematically studied. Japanese entomologists Yui Imasaki and Tomoji Endo of Kobe College decided to learn more about the relationship of lice I. I'm not going to be a harmandi. In 2010-2015, researchers lured the females of these insects using traps from hollow bamboo stems. The authors waited for the bear to build a nest inside the stems, fill it with prey, lay eggs inside and seal the nest with a seal. They then collected nests at different stages of development, counted how many eggs and larvae were in them, and, if possible, determined the sex of the offspring. In total, Imasaaki and Endo have collected 495 nests. Harmandi, 318 of which had offspring at different stages of development and feed for him. Each nest had an average of 9.2 eggs, but the average number of nested larvae was 4.2. Thus, during the development of eggs and larvae, the number of larvae decreased by 54 percent, which may indicate larval cannibalism. It decreased most strongly in the early and late stages. In 69 cases, researchers estimated the mass of the nest. On average, one nest contained 3,09 grams of larval food. The female wasps provided the females with a little more than the males did: the first left on average 3.91 grams of prey, and the second left 2.97 grams. However, this difference was statistically untrue (p=0.06). The authors were unable to find any connection between the size of the slate and the amount of stockpile. In theory, the octopus should store as much prey as the whole extraction needs (or, conversely, lay as many eggs as the larvae can grow by the stockpile of prey), but it cannot predict in advance how many victims and how much it will catch. To confirm that the larvae I. The harmandi really eat each other, and Imasaki and Endo have grown 39 of these insects in the lab. After studying the contents of the nests in which these extracts developed, the researchers returned the eggs, larvae, and their food back to the bamboo stem, sealed it and placed it in a plastic container, counting the number of survivors in the puppet and imaga stage. Initially, there were 265 lice in 39 derivatives. However, only 156 of them survived to be occulted, which corresponds to 58.9 percent. The adults came out of 101 coconuts. In 30 nests, the number of outlets fell in the larval stage, and in 23  in the occuling stage. After analyzing these data, Imasaki and Endo concluded that the mass of stored feed positively affects the lichen's survival before hatching, and the initial number of extracts  negatively (p=0.05 and p=0.005 respectively). In other words, the youngest of the bees live to adulthood in nests where there is little prey and little larvae, and the least where there is little prey and lots of larvae. At the same time, none of these factors had any effect on the percentage of coconuts that the imago would produce. These patterns are consistent with the idea that the lack of food is driving the larvae I. Harmandi to cannibalism. In the final stage, Imasaki and Endo raised nineteen I. Harmandi outside the nests, in plastic containers (in each outlet there were three to nine larvae, a total of 84). Every five minutes, the larvae were photographed. It allowed us to see them eating brothers and sisters. The acts of cannibalism were noted in 14 conclusions, which corresponds to 74 percent. In this experiment, 54 percent of the lice died, with 76 percent being eaten by siblings (the cause of death of ten more lice could not be established, perhaps they were also eaten by siblings). The authors note that sometimes cannibals were larger than their victims, but often they were attacked by larvae of about the same size. The results of the study show that the larvae I. Harmandi eat brothers and sisters regularly. This usually happens when one larva has too little stock. Imasaki and Endo believe that this mechanism allows for effective reduction of the number of extracts in the case of a lack of feed (and successfully cope with the fact that the female cannot predict how much feed she will manage to stock up). If there is enough food, the larvae can live together peacefully. Earlier, we talked about how entomologists have disproved the hypothesis that explains why the Central American ruthless bee Melipona beecheii produces far more uterus than the colony needs. Previously, it was thought that the excess females leave the house, take the place of the womb in other colonies and spread the genetic material of the native family to the population through social parasitism. However, it turned out that the species was unable to penetrate the colony of relatives. Moreover, contrary to previous studies, the working individuals M. Beecheii do not regulate the caste of larvae to produce more breeding females. The future caste of this species is likely to be genetically engineered. This mechanism creates a conflict between the worker worms who are favorably maternal and the worker individuals who are trying to preserve the community. It's a very cruel decision: workers just kill most of the newborn wombs. Sergei Kelenov"

    "translated_title": "Chinese customs officers accidentally discovered a new species of cockroach",
    "translated_text": "Last spring, customs officials in the Chinese city of Zhongshan found a small cockroach in a South American log. The insect was passed on to zoologists, who concluded that they were facing a previously unknown species of the genus Latindia. In the future, experts expect to obtain additional specimens of this species of cockroach to describe it and give it a scientific name. The results of the study were published in an article for the Chinese Journal of Vector Biology and Control. Most people know only a few species of cockroaches. Among them are the red cockroach (Blattella germanica), black cockroach (Blatta orientalis) and the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), which live in our homes, as well as the Madagascar spitting cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa), which has become a popular pet. And lovers of exotic pets may also remember marble cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea), which are raised as a food item for domestic reptiles, amphibians, bird-eating spiders, and owls. However, the Blattodea are actually much more diverse. According to zoologists, it includes nearly 4,500 species of cockroaches and more than 3,000 species of their closest relatives  termites. Although many cockroaches are unremarkable, they also have distinctive species. For example, rotting tree-eating cockroaches Salganea taiwanensis have unusual marital behavior. In this species, males and females mate and flap their wings. And the South American cockroaches Melyroidea magnifica may have a caste division, including the breeding queen and the working class. Zoologists regularly describe new species of cockroaches. One of these discoveries was made by Chinese customs officials. On May 11, 2021, they examined a shipment of wood that had arrived from French Guiana at the port of Zhongshan City in Guangdong province and found a 5.8 millimeter-long yellowish-brown cockroach. To identify the species, the insect was transferred to a team of specialists led by Yue Qiao-yun of Zhongshan Polytechnic University. By studying the structure of the cockroach's body and analyzing its genome, zoologists determined that it belongs to the genus Latindia, which includes nine species native to Central and South America. However, the specimen had a number of unique morphological features, so researchers concluded that it belonged to a previously unknown species. They plan to formally describe it and give it a scientific name when they have additional specimens, including females, at their disposal. In addition, the authors studied another cockroach, which was found by the Zhongshan customs officials in the Guian woodland two months before the first, in March 2021. It was the male of the now-famous species Latindia dohrniana. Interestingly, until the spring of 2021, Latindia cockroaches were never seen in China. Earlier, we told you about how biologists discovered endemic cockroaches called Panesthia lata on Lord Howe Island, which had not been seen here since the 1930s. These insects were thought to have died off on the island because of the rats and mice they had brought in and only survived on small islands off the coast. However, it turns out that the cockroaches managed to survive in the hard-to-reach area north of Lord Howe."

    "translated_text": "Planetologists modeled the DART collision with the asteroid Dimorph and concluded that if the body had low coagulation strength, the impact would not produce a normal crater. Instead, some of the asteroid's matter will be moved and discarded, leading to a global change in its shape. The article was published in The Planetary Science Journal. The DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) project was the first experimental test of one of the planetary protection techniques. During a taran controlled by the apparatus of the small asteroid Dimorph, which is part of the double system (65803) Dimim, its orbital period is expected to change by 4-7 minutes, which will be interpreted as a success. The tarant is scheduled to attempt on October 2, 2022, and in 2027 the Hera station will reach Dimorph, which will explore the system in detail and confirm the change in Dimorph's orbit. I'm not sure what I'm saying. Raducan) and Martin Jutzi of the University of Bern published the results of modeling the collision process of a DART-type object with small spherical and ellipsoidal asteroids to assess the possible outcome of such an event. Scientists have concluded that the magnitude of the change in the asteroid's orbit depends heavily on the properties of its surface and substrate, and that asteroids less than 50 kilometers in diameter are the result of the decay of a larger parent body. Such objects (such as Ryuga or Bennu) can be \"glitter hooks\"  aglomerates held together only by their own gravity or small grip forces. Scientists used a shock model based on the hydrodynamics of smoothed particles and taking into account the behavior of geological materials and the sealing of porous matter during collisions. The body-shooter in the model was a 500-kilogram sphere, about 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter density, moving at 6 kilometers per second. The asteroid's evolution was studied for 2 hours after impact. The researchers found that collision events where the impact size is less than 1/150 of the size of the target can still significantly deform poorly interconnected asteroids. The less the asteroid's coagulation strength, the more of it will move (up to 20 percent) or be thrown away (up to 3 percent) at speeds greater than the escape rate. Planetologists believe that Dimorph's strength is less than 50 Pascals, if it is at 10 Pascals, then the DART impact may not lead to the formation of a classical crater, but will lead to a global change in the asteroid's shape. The angle of DART's assault on Dimorph is unlikely to have a significant impact on this process.

    "translated_title": "The Koreans made a \"plast\" with a defibrillator and a ballast cardiograph",
    "translated_text": "Korean engineers They've developed a sensor that combines pressure sensors, ECG electrodes, and defibrillators. Unlike the devices used in modern arithmetic, an electrode can be Just stick it to the surface of the heart like a patch. Experiments with a heart model and in vivo on a rabbit showed that the sensor is not rejected, and its functions allow for the detection and treatment of tachy and brady arrhythmias. As the authors of the paper published in Science Advances showed, using The sensor can not only measure the nature of arrhythmia and heart rate, But also to understand how the body's blood circulation suffers during the attack. The first implantable electrical heartbeat stimulator was created in 1958. And over the years these devices have made their way to high-tech implanted autonomous devices, almost impervious to the surrounding magnetic fields, capable of To adjust to the level of physical activity of his master, to keep data about your heart 's electrical activity and transmit it to your doctors over Wi-Fi (just learn how to store that data safely). Despite the enormous progress In some areas, some of the difficulties remain. Implanted devices that provide cardiac stimulation and control the electrical activity of the heart (electrocardiostimulators, devices for cardiac resynchronizing therapy, implantable cardioverters-defibrillators And lately, the modulators. heart rate) requires a reduction in the electrodes inside the heart cavities, which are full of unwanted effects. First, the introduction of electrodes into the vein can be complicated by bleeding from the connective vein during or after surgery. Second, the electrode, which has been in the heart cells for years, It's a potential source of blood infections, and population studies estimate the incidence of this serious complication at more than half a percent. In recent years companies that develop devices that developers think should minimize These risks  for example, suggest A heartbeat without electrodes, all in the right ventricle. There are other options for the epicardial. stimulation when the electrode is attached to the outside. This method can be an alternative for patients with extremely high In children with a growing heart and a constantly changing endocardial electrode. But because of the difficulty of fixing The electrode and complexity of the co-ordination of shrinkage technology is not getting widespread. Korean engineers and Doctors led by Hwang Jae Chul have proposed a method that continues the idea of epicardial I'm not a cardio driver. They created a multi-component electrode with a total thickness of just over a millimeter that attaches directly to the The outer shell of the heart, the epicard. Unlike most recent prototypes, the sensor is capable of measuring the stretch and shrinkage of the heart wall, which gives rise to the methodology of ballast cardio that developed in the middle of the past, but was discontinued with the advent of echocardiography. The structure consists of 11 layers of approximately one millimeter thickness, functionally comprising three parts. The lower part of the heart, the 100 transistor matrix, where a perforated electrode is inserted between electrodes in different layers of the sensor. It's a silicone layer. The compression of this layer by heart contraction leads to The electrical resistance of the air in the holes changes, and processing this signal allows you to create a map of the heart pressure at different points of contact with the sensor. Next layer of sensor  gold electrodes for recording EKG and stimulating Platinum electrodes with a thickness of 60 nanometers. Finally, the sensor was covered on the outside with a catechoalginate layer that became sticky when it came into contact with the muscle in the presence of calcium ions. If necessary, it could be removed with a sensor from the surface of the heart without damaging the muscle below. Experiments with the prototype It's been shown to measure the heart muscle deformation quite accurately and to measure the change in pressure within 200 degrees. Kilopascal (in subsequent animal experiments the peak values were 2-2,5 times lower), and the sensor 's resolution ability allowed it to work at The pressure range that is characteristic of the human cardiovascular system. For the sake of 5000 compressions and stretches (about 1.5 hours of human heart work at rest) and two months of being at a temperature and pH close to human, there were no signs of sensor degradation. Answer to the Force The heart rate is a function of muscle thickness. The rigid and unyielding hypertrophied wall exerted less pressure on the electrode at a higher pressure in the And this also indirectly allowed us to assess the severity of myocardial hypertrophy. I got a confirmation . The system was implanted into the heart of a live rabbit (control was done through a computer, not an implanted device). As the author of the method had expected, That a matrix of a hundred transistors covering the heart of an animal 10×10 millimeters reproduces the strength of the reduction of individual sections of the heart muscle with a resolution of one It's a millimeter. The stimulating electrode He's been working on medication for bradycardia and defibrillation. Electrical The heart activity was seen on the ECG, which was recorded by the electrodes of the sensor. In an experiment with super-frequency stimulation (up to 580 per minute) has been shown to increase the amplitude of heart muscle contractions. It's going down with increasing stimulation frequency. This is because the heart is The high frequency of the shrinkage is not enough to fill the diastole with blood, which is And that's what's causing the symptoms of cardiac arrest in these cases. The lower the left ventricle wall pressure the sensor showed, the lower the blood supply in the sublingual artery. The animal. Animal monitoring in the 10 weeks and subsequent histological examination of the tissues showed no signs of an immune response to the implant or signs of its degradation. It was unable to pass through ultrasound, and when the rabbit's heart was examined by ultrasound, the part of the organ under the sensor was found to be a black spot. The proposed methodology It's remarkable in a few ways. First, the combination of mechanical and electrical The characteristics of the heart activity give important information about the hemodynamic The importance of arrhythmia. In different patients, some types of arrhythmias can cause cause a variety of effects, from mild dizziness to clinical death, And if arrhythmia occurs rarely or in sleep, it's not always registered. It's a great way to understand its importance. In addition, the assessment of the reduction of individual myocardial sites when loaded can help assess heart muscle ischemia, Because in the case of oxygen starvation, the heart shrinks less. Medical School The diagnostic devices are not in place, and we're closely tracking them. The development. Recently published - portable The ultrasound sensor and contact lenses It's for the treatment of glaucoma. And if the sensor is to be attached to the body, then its location You can always change it by gluing monorails on your clothes and typing new coordinates. Sergei Zadvoryev"

    "translated_title": "Fractal properties of spine ice explain the anomalous dynamics of magnetic quasi-monopolists",
    "translated_text": "Physicists from several countries were able to understand the causes of a number of abnormal properties in the spinal ice observed in the experiment, namely the strange frequency dependence of magnetic noise and the temperature dependence of relaxation time. The one-parameter model, built by the authors, showed that the movement of magnetic quasi-monopoly in these environments can be partially limited, which is why the area available to them for movement acquires fractal properties. The study was published in Science. Spine ice is of interest to physicists because of the unusual emergent dynamics that arise in it. They're a chain of tetrahedra with backs built into them. When two of the backs of all the grid tetrahedra are pointed inward and two outward, it speaks to one of many basic back ice states. Elemental excitation in a lattice occurs when one of the spines is turned. The waves of coups can spread further along the grid, which physicists describe as the movement of effective magnetic monopolies linked together by Dirac strings. However, scientists do not yet fully understand what is happening inside the spinal ice. Recent experiments using supersensitive magnetometers (SCDs) have revealed anomalies in the intensity of magnetic noise from the frequency. If for paramagnetics it's a degree function with a value of two, then for spine ice it's equal to one and a half. Physicists from England, Argentina, Germany, and the United States, with the participation of Jonathan Hallén of Cambridge University, were able to find the cause of this deviation. Earlier, a team pointed out that the local (transverse) distribution of fields could suppress the dynamics of the spins. Along with the emergent calibration field, this effect randomly limits the movement of the monopoly. Thus, the area of permitted motion looks like an unordered porous environment with fractal properties, even if the mesh of the real crystal is free of defects. Fractal is used to mean similar geometric objects, but in mathematics, their definition is much broader. It also includes randomly organized structures, such as porous environments like bread or sponges. Their shape varies on a large and small scale, but their mathematical description is related. An important property of fractals is that they can be small in size. For example, the size of a piece of bread varies between two and three times. To capture this effect, the authors modified the standard hamiltonan, which describes dipole interactions in the spinal ice by suppressing the spinal portion's twists. They selected the parameters of the model in a way that matched their calculations to the results of experiments in the Dy2Ti2O7 monocrystal. In the temperature range chosen by scientists (about one kelvin), the energy in the crystal is enough to trigger magnetic quasi-monopoly, but it is not enough to overlook the interaction between them. The only free parameter in the model was the time of the unlocked spins' turn. Physicists restored it by tuning. The result was a very good consensus with the measured spectra of noise at four frequencies and six intensities, and the parameter was 85 microseconds. The free-frame model also solved another problem, namely the strange dependence of the time of relaxation of excitations in the spinal ice on temperature. The fractal nature of quasi-monopoly dynamics was only preserved on a microscopic scale and disappeared on a macro scale. To understand it better, physicists have been monitoring how the fractal structure grows as the chemical distance increases, that is, the number of lattice nodes that a monopoly can visit in n steps. Up to n=14 this dependence was described as a degree function with a value of 1,85. With this number of steps, the structure contained only 130 nodes out of 2071 possible ones. In large numbers of steps, the dynamics of the system became three-dimensional, which is expressed in the low frequency plateau on the spectra. Scientists link this to the influence of other monopolies. It is noteworthy that the term quantum field theory is actively used in spine ice physics. For example, the standard model is called the standard model, and the authors called their study the standard model. The phenomena described in this way behave similarly to their quantum field counterparts, but only exist within the spinal ice. We've talked about how the equivalent of a constant thin structure in this environment has grown tenfold."

    "translated_title": "Chinese scientists have stripped mice of their chromosomes. And then another one.",
    "translated_text": "Chinese scientists have tried a new method of genomic engineering: they've learned to tie mouse chromosomes together. It turns out that if the chromosomes aren't very large, it's easy to glue them together and get a muscle with an odd number of chromosomes. These animals can grow healthy and fertile and interbreed with normal lab mice. And in the third generation, the researchers were able to get a mouse without two chromosomes at once -- that is, with 19 pairs instead of 20. The work was published in the journal Science. A normal lab mouse has 40 chromosomes, which is 20 pairs. That number hasn't changed since scientists have been experimenting with them and keeping them in captivity. However, it is known that a change in chromosome number is not always fatal. For example, in humans, the chromosome is two times smaller than in gorillas (48 years old), and it seems that after our evolutionary paths diverged from them, the two chromosomes merged into one. A group of scientists from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences led by Wei Li tried to reproduce this phenomenon in mice  that is, using genetic engineering techniques to sew together a pair of mouse chromosomes. To do this, they had to shorten the chromosomes from the ends, as the chromosomes end up with telomeres on both sides. In addition, mice have a centrometer at one end of each chromosome, which is important for division, a structure that most human chromosomes have in the center (we talked about them in the text \"Journey to the Center of the Genome\"). So to attach one chromosome to the other, you have to cut off the telomer from both, and then cut off the centromer from the other. The experimental authors chose two pairs as targets: chromosomes 1 and 2 (the largest in the mouse genome) and 4 and 5 (medium size). 1 and 2 were combined in two ways: one was to donate centrometer 1, and the other was to donate centrometer 2. The researchers worked with haploid embryonic stem cells of mice. They worked on the method of getting these lines earlier when they were creating a mouse from two mothers and two fathers. They took mouse eggs, removed the nucleus, and fertilized them with sperm, and then they forced them to divide. The culture of cells with a single set of chromosomes (i.e. haploid) was obtained . In such cells, it's much more convenient to do genomic engineering because, unlike normal cells, you don't have to try to get both copies of the chromosome at once. In these haploid cells, scientists used the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system, poisoning it with centromers and telomeres: it had to cut through the edges of these chromosome segments, thus \"cutting\" them all off. Next, scientists thought that cells should have a repair system for the  proteins that make holes in DNA. These proteins were supposed to detect sticky ends of the chromosome and then sew them together. To test the result, the researchers painted the resulting chromosomes  and it turned out that chromosomes 4 and 5 are glued together just as well as 2 to 1. But the 1 + 2 design didn't work out: chromosome 1 broke down into two pieces, one of which merged with chromosome 2, and the other one merged with chromosome 17. The experimenters then grew the culture from genome-engineered cells. To do this, they had to sort and discard those that had spontaneously deployed, that is, obtained a second set of chromosomes. The researchers found that the cells continued to have embryonic stem cell properties: they expressed a similar set of genes and could differentiate into the precursors of nerve cells by signaling substances. Then the researchers took only the cells that had been deployed and tested how well their cell division mechanisms worked. It turns out that only cells with 4 + 5 and 1 + 2 hybrids (with 1 chromosome sliced) do well. But the 2+1 hybrid didn't cross that bar, as the authors concluded, and the chromosome was too long and bulky to fit in the place it was assigned. Finally, scientists tried to create whole mice with a modified set of chromosomes. To do this, they removed three parts of the genome in haploid cells using the same CRISPR/Cas9  that's needed to compensate for the lack of maternal chromosomes (how this works and how this is imprinted, we've talked about in the \"Half-Self\" material). Then we fused these cells with mouse eggs that carried the green fluorescent protein  so we could see if the mother chromosomes were still in the cells. They produced embryos with different chromosomal hybrids that were implanted into surrogate mothers. Mice with a hybrid of 2 + 1 never lived to be born  they had too many polyplyoid cells (more than two sets of chromosomes). But there were 14 cubs with the 4 + 5 hybrid and 37  with the 1 + 2 hybrid. Their cells had 39 chromosomes instead of 40, with all 20 in one set, and in the second  two glued together. But the abnormal genome didn't stop them from growing and developing: they were born with the same weight as normal mice. True, the 1 + 2 hybrids have a higher level of anxiety compared to the 4 + 5 hybrids and the normal mice (p &lt;0.001). The researchers suspected that the Capn11  gene was on chromosome 17 and could have been damaged when merged with a section of chromosome 1. Then he was removed from the normal mice and they started acting more anxious too. An anomalous set of chromosomes could prevent mice from multiplying  because when sex cells form each chromosome must meet its homologous (i.e. the same number of chromosomes from the second set). The 1 + 2 hybrid didn't do that: none of the 30 mice could have children. And the 4+5 hybrids did this, even though their fertility was below average: they had offspring from healthy partners. Among the next generation mice were those with separate chromosomes 4 and 5 in one set, and sewn in another. Researchers crossed these mice with each other and produced the mice-grandchildren, including animals with two hybrid chromosomes 4 + 5. They had 19 pairs of chromosomes, which is two fewer than normal. So the researchers created a model that could study, among other things, the mechanisms of chromosome evolution. For example, they've already found that when a chromosome is hybridized, the size of the chromosome is important. Too large chromosomes can merge, but individuals don't survive. And smaller chromosomes, on the contrary, are easily sewn together, and that doesn't necessarily lead to problems. Moreover, even one hybridization event does not produce reproductive isolation  and individuals with one fused chromosome continue to successfully cross with the original chromosome set carriers. For a detailed description of how scientists created organisms with the smallest possible genome and copied their DNA, see our article entitled \"The Right to Correspondence\". And recently, we were able to collect an artificial bacteriophage for the first time. Polina Loseva"

    "translated_title": "The humpback whales have been swimming at night and saving their strength .",
    "translated_text": "Brazilian zoologists have witnessed the unusual behavior of humpback whales. During the night shift, the researchers spotted two adults and a baby behind the three hornets' feeding. They escorted the ship for an hour. It appears that the whales have settled the transverse waves that spread from the feed to save energy during their migration to breeding grounds. The authors' observations are described in a print that is posted on ResearchGate. Dolphins often accompany moving vessels. They are not supposed to do so out of curiosity or a desire to communicate with people, but to save energy. By adhering to the low pressure areas that result from the waves diverging from the ship, dolphins can swim with minimal effort. Occasionally, large whales behave similarly. This was personally proved by a team of zoologists led by Guilherme Maricato of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In July 2020, researchers were sailing along the southeastern coast of Brazil. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, they spotted two adults and one baby within ten metres of the feeding grounds of three humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). For the next hour, the animals walked in the keel of the ship, which was traveling at 9-11 kilometers per hour, sometimes shortening the distance to five meters. The researchers were able to record the whales on video. The southern Atlantic right whale feeds in the waters around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and breeds off the east coast of Brazil. Along the southeastern coast of the country, a migratory corridor of the humpback rhinos connects the nagula sites with the breeding grounds. The ship was heading north, the same direction as the whales move during the southern hemisphere winter. Researchers suggest that the three whales they encountered chose to use the waves from the accompanying vessel to facilitate their journey to breeding grounds. Unlike the dolphins, they did not settle in divergent waves, but in transverse waves that spread from the feed. The baby boy and his mother probably benefited particularly from the ship's escort. The fact is that young whales are hard-pressed to travel far; they also have to come to the surface often for oxygen. And the female whales, when feeding their offspring, consume a lot of energy, and any chance of saving it increases their chances of survival. For example, a minimum amount of exercise can then lead to less time spent resting. Marinato and his co-authors note that this is the first documented case of humpback whales following a ship for so long. Besides, this kind of behavior has never been recorded at night before. Researchers' observations show how little we know about the night's activity of whales. However, the fact that these mammals can accompany ships at night should be taken into account when designing measures to protect them from collisions with ships. Earlier, we talked about how zoologists have recorded record numbers of southern fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the 20th century, these whales were almost extinct because of whalers, but now their numbers are starting to recover. Researchers estimate that about 8,000 fin whales gather in the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula to feed on their wings, and for the first time in over two hundred years, they have begun to form groups of more than 15 individuals.

    "translated_title": "Physicists have learned to spin neutrons properly.",
    "translated_text": "Physicists from Canada and the United States have conducted an experiment on the full spin of neutrons. In previous studies, the curvature was only observed statistically because the wavelength of the neutron front could not cover the entire phase plate. In the new work, each neutron was coiled by an array of more than six million spindle diffraction plates. The study was published in Science Advances. In recent years, neutrons have become an important tool in the hands of physicists. Because of their large mass and electrical neutrality, these particles have a high penetration capacity, and their nanometer wavelength and magnetic momentum make them suitable for studying the properties of matter and even for finding new physics. In addition, neutron interferometry and neutron spectroscopy are also being actively developed, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994. To get the most benefit from neutrons, physicists needed to learn to control as many of their properties as possible. First of all, it's about the momentum, energy, and the back of the particles. Neutron wave parameters are also available to the controller. So phase control is achieved by a neutron interferometer. The last thing physicists aren't very good at is controlling the wavefront shape of neutrons. For example, the simplest operation that can be done over the wavefronts of photons, namely changing their curvature using a collection or scattering lens, is not that simple to do with neutrons, because the neutron rate of breakdown of available materials differs slightly from the unit. Turning neutrons (i.e. giving them an orbital moment) is also quite difficult, since the width of the wavefront's coherence does not exceed several centimeters, and the length  micrometers. This prevents the use of phase plates  wave-curring devices successfully used for light or sound,  because their size is noticeably larger. Instead, physicists work with the average orbital moments of neutrons, which are obtained after collecting statistics on how many neutrons pass through different places in the phase plate. This was not the case for American and Canadian physicists led by University of Waterloo physicist Dmitry Pushin. Unlike their previous research, they used a holographic method of spinning using fork diffraction plates. In such devices, the curvature occurs in non-zero diffraction orders. And to make sure that each neutron had to rotate, physicists made a square array of 6,250,000 of these plates, 2,500 pieces in each row and column. The plate was formed on a silicon substrate with a period of two microns, and the final side of the square array was equal to five millimeters. The authors have produced three arrays: topological charge (i.e. orbital moment) equal to zero, three and seven. The first sample was needed for a control experiment. The curvature of the particles manifests itself in the form of a polar phase distribution resembling a flower petal and an intensity distribution resembling a bubble. The greater the orbital moment, the more \"leafs\" and the greater the radius of the bubble. The authors limited themselves to measuring the distribution of intensity. The neutrons for the experiment were generated by a high-current isotope reactor located in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in low-angle dispersion mode. Physicists pointed particles at the mass and measured the distribution of intensity in different order of diffraction. Experiments have shown that for all masses except the control, rings occur in the first order of diffraction, and their size is in good agreement with the theory. The experimental conditions suggest that each neutron carried an orbital moment. I hope that in the future, physicists will have access to the phase properties of twisted neutrons and be able to demonstrate \"flippers\". And while you're at it, you can look at the phased distribution of the twisted sound."

    "translated_title": "Childhood loneliness predicted alcohol problems in adulthood",
    "translated_text": "American psychologists have concluded that people who experience loneliness as children (under the age of 12) tend to respond more strongly to stress, making them more vulnerable to alcohol-related problems between the ages of 18 and 29. The results of the study are published in Addictive Behaviors Reports. One third of people in industrialized countries experience loneliness. And this feeling is subjective, it's not dependent on social isolation, and even with active social interaction, people can feel lonely. According to the Evolutionary Model of Loneliness, the rejection of social isolation works through social pain and reward to stimulate social reunification. When a person's need for belonging is not satisfied, it leads to cognitive, behavioral, and neuro-physiological distress. In addition, loneliness was associated with a more pronounced subjective sense of stress. Interestingly, children can feel and understand loneliness as a concept different from social isolation by the age of five. However, perceived social isolation in childhood affects later life and may be associated with a lack of social skills, sleep disorders, depression and substance use in adulthood. People use a variety of ways to cope with stress, including alcohol. There is even a stress-damping model, where alcohol is used to reduce negative emotions. It was found that copying motives for alcohol use were associated with increased control disorder. Alcohol abuse is the inability to control the use of a psychoactive substance in an independent way, in terms of its beginning, amount, and end. It is thought to be a potential mechanism that leads to drinking problems in people who are sensitive to stress. Psychologists at Arizona State University under the direction of Julie Patock-Peckham have found a link between childhood loneliness under the age of 12 and perceived stress and alcohol abuse among emerging adults between the ages of 18 and 29. The study involved 310 students (154 women and 156 men) over the age of 18. Using an online questionnaire, they assessed their childhood loneliness, perceived stress, lack of control, alcohol use, and drinking problems. 85 percent of the participants said they drank alcohol, and 12.3 percent said they drank as minors. Psychologists analyzed the data using structural equations and the bustrup method (k = 20 000). Researchers also included sex as a covariation, as previous studies noted differences in behavior between men and women in the context of alcohol use. High levels of childhood loneliness were indirectly associated with higher impaired control due to greater stress [indirect effect = 0.100, S. E. = 0.026, Z = 3.816, p &lt;0,001, 95 percent confidence interval (0.052, 0.155)]. Also, high levels of loneliness up to 12 years of age were indirectly associated with more frequent alcohol use due to increased stress and, in turn, with higher impaired control [indirect effect = 0.024, S. E. The value of the data is 0,009, Z = 2,836, p = 0,005, 95 percent confidence interval (0,010, 0,043)]. There is also a side effect between childhood loneliness and alcohol problems in adulthood [side effect = 0.042, S. E. = 0,013, Z = 3,150, p = 0,002, 95 percent confidence interval (0,020, 0,072)]. In all three categories, female gender was indirectly linked to higher levels of stress, disordered control, alcohol use, and related problems. Thus, higher levels of childhood loneliness directly predicted drinking problems in adulthood and indirectly predicted a higher likelihood of unregulated alcohol use due to stress, especially among women. Scientists have previously discovered how the neural network connecting the medial orbitofrontal cortex to the central gray matter of the midbrain is involved in the formation of alcohol dependence in adolescents. And American researchers have shown that drinking alcohol together reduces physical distance between strangers. The Hope of Chekasin"

    "translated_text": "The CMS collaboration physicists published an impressive amount of data collected by their detector during the first season of the Big Hadron Collider. It consists of 491 terabytes, broken down into 42 datasets, and contains proton-proton collision results, as well as a guide and source code for algorithms. You can find all the information on the CERN website. The large-scale Hadron Collider at the European Nuclear Research Centre (CERN) is known for generating a huge amount of data. They're being assembled by several BAC detectors, the largest of which are the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb quartet (which we regularly write about as \"Collaider\"). An important condition that was laid down in the creation of CERN  is the openness of the data collected and the scientific results obtained on their basis. This is reflected in the requirement that all BAC collaborations have open access status, as well as the regular publication of the collected data archive, which CERN has been conducting since 2014. We recently reported that physicists working on the LHCb detector shared a 200 terabyte archive with anyone they wanted. The published datasets contain a fifth of the information about proton-proton collisions that occurred in the detector during the first season of the BAC. Now, a similar data set is shared by the CMS collaboration. The total amount of information contained in 42 new datasets is 491 terabytes. It includes everything that was collected by the CMS detector in 2012 during the first season of the collider. Some of this data was used to discover the Higgs boson, which won the Nobel Prize for physics to François Engler and Peter Higgs in 2013. Like their LHCb colleagues, CMS physicists have also published detailed guides to interpret data, as well as the source code of the programs that helps them do this. Now scientists are preparing the next set of data to be published, which will include the results of heavy ion experiments during the first season, as well as the proton-proton collisions that occurred in the second season."

    "translated_title": "The tree-flicking mollusks got rid of the competitors with the help of fecal pipes",
    "translated_text": "Zoologists have found out why some sunken trees become trash in just a few months, while others decay in a few years. The first to be found were the tree-dwelling shells of the genus Xylophaga dorsalis, which quickly settle and eat the wood. These creatures effectively fight their competitors with their own feces. First, they attract lice of their own species by using fecal tubes that run over the surface of the wood. As a result, the number of Xylophaga dorsalis tree-flies in a piece of wood grows, and their feces are pushed to the surface. This leaves so little oxygen in the wood that most other organisms cannot survive in it. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal Marine Biodiversity. Many deep-water creatures feed on the remains of plants and animals that have descended from the ocean floor. For example, the body of a drowned whale has been fed for decades by a variety of creatures, from sharks and mixins to mollusks, cancers, and bacteria. Some of them are narrow-minded professionals who live only on whale tugs. An example is the multi-splinter worm Osedax, which derives nutrients from the bones of whales by dissolving the proteins and lipids in them using symbiotic bacteria. Another valuable source of food on the seabed is the food taken out to sea and the trees that have gone down. It is used, in particular, by specialized double-shaped molluscs of the family Xylophagaidae, which includes seven genera and more than sixty species. These creatures move around in sunken trees using a variety of grapefruit-sized crustaceans and eat wood, digesting cellulose through symbiotic bacteria. Tree-floating mollusks are considered ecosystem engineers because they create habitats for many other organisms and convert nutrients from wood into a form that is accessible to them. In some cases, biodiversity islands in sunken and eaten by xylophagoid trees have existed for several years. However, often within a few months, these shells leave only a fragile stump on the wood, which can be broken with a simple handshake. Janet Voight (born Jan R. Voight) from the Field Museum of Natural History and her colleagues suggested that the differences in decay rates of sunken trunks were due to competition between different species of xylophage and other consumers of wood. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared the results of several field experiments conducted between 1979 and 2017. During these studies, the experts placed pieces of wood, mostly of coniferous species, at a depth of 200 to 3,232 meters and tracked their fate for several months. Ten experiments were conducted in the northeast Pacific Ocean, two in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, and another one in the Norwegian fjord. Of the 15 pieces of wood used in the experiments, seven were eaten to the point of crumbling in the hands. They were all inhabited by tree-dwelling Xylophaga dorsalis. Seven of the remaining eight samples were inhabited by representatives of other groups of xylophages. Environmental factors had a small impact on the extent of wood consumption. So the shells are from the X-ray. Dorsalis destroy wood much more actively and faster than their relatives. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies that showed that shells in this group are more active in the submerged wood and grow faster than other xylophages. In the next stage, Vaughn and his co-authors focused on the features of tree-moving X-ray molluscs. The dorsalis. The output syphon is short and opens up inside the wooden walk. As a result, the mollusk's feces settle inside this passage and form a mucous tube that is released outside the wood. It's also called the fecal fumigation. For comparison, in other species of the family, the long-drawn siphon goes beyond the flow and allows the feces to be thrown into the water. The analysis showed that the fecal tubes are X-type. dorsalis and belonging to the same class X. Oregona is composed primarily of organic matter, primarily lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. The first of these two species also has a higher sulfur concentration. The authors believe that the X-ray shells are a The dorsalis are supercompetitors that inhabit and eat sunken trees before other tree-dwellers can reach them. This is evidenced by the high rate of decay and low biodiversity of the wood inhabited by the members of this group. This strategy is justified because the representatives of this treasure are settled in the depths where drowned trees are quite common. The larvae easily find and populate them, then grow into adult individuals, quickly eat the wood and produce a new generation of larvae. Maybe the fecal fumes are X. The dorsalis and related species make it easier for them to fight the competition. First, these tubes attract specific larvae. After detecting a pile of smoke on the surface of a piece of wood, the shellfish larvae from this treasure realize that their relatives have already settled here, and therefore they are also incorporated into it. The result is the density of tree stumps in group X. The dorsalis grows in a sunken tree. As these creatures grow larger, their fecal tubes increase in size and almost completely block the paths leading to the surface of the wood. As a result, the oxygen availability in the tree fell sharply. X. Dorsalis and related species are well adapted to hypoxia, but other tree-dwelling species cannot tolerate such conditions and therefore die or refuse to settle near them. So the shells are group X. The dorsalis get a piece of wood at their disposal. The most famous tree-moving mollusks are the shipworm family (Teredinidae). However, not all of them eat wood. For example, the recently described giant Kuphus polythalamia eats wood only in its early stages of development, then moves to the bottom and receives nutrients and energy through symbiosis with bacteria. Lithoredo abatanica prefers to bite the limestone. Both species are native to the Philippines."

    "translated_title": "Psychologists have linked pessimism to memory impairment in adulthood",
    "translated_text": "Psychologists in Finland have found that optimism about your future at a young age is associated with high levels of abstract thinking, and pessimistic views of the future at an older age  with low memory. The authors of the paper, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, collected data from people aged 26 and 46 years to compare the relationship between optimistic and pessimistic expectations of life and cognitive abilities. Dispositional optimism and pessimism reflect a person's positive or negative expectations of their future. Research often links higher levels of optimism to positive characteristics  longer life expectancy and good sleep quality. But pessimism is more often associated with negative aspects of life, such as alcoholism and negative traits. The development and maintenance of high levels of cognitive function is influenced by various factors of life, including nutrition, psychological and environmental conditions. In particular, research suggests that there is a link between optimism and different types of thinking and working memory, but how pessimism and optimism are linked to cognitive abilities at different ages is not entirely clear. Finnish psychologists led by Jutta Karhu of the University of Oulu conducted a study to study the link between optimism and pessimism and cognitive ability. To do this, they invited two groups of participants in a national longitudinal study to fill out questionnaires and perform cognitive tasks. The first group included 383 people aged 25 to 27, and the second group included 5042 people aged 46. All participants completed a Disposition Optimism Questionnaire, which asked them to rate their statements about their views of the future, and the tasks for cognitive abilities for the groups were different. The young people took the abstract thinking and verbal skills tests from the Wexler test, as well as the Strup test and additional tests for speech proficiency, motor skills, response and memory retardation. The participants in the senior group only took a memory test. The results of correlation analysis in both groups showed a link between higher levels of dispositional optimism and higher levels of education and lower levels of depression. The pessimism correlated with the reverse. The connection between these structures and cognitive abilities varied between groups. For younger people, higher pessimism scores corresponded to lower scores on tasks such as abstract thinking, motor skills, and vocabulary. High optimism in this group correlated only with the indicators of abstract thinking. In the older group, dispositional optimism was associated with a higher level of education for the mother and a higher score on the memory task, and pessimism correlated backwards with both parameters. Multiple regression confirmed the relationship between pessimism and low abstract thinking rates in young people (p = 0.001) and low memory rates in the senior group of participants (p = 0.034) in the final model. Thus, the authors found that young optimists have higher ratios of abstract thinking, such as the ability to reason, identify patterns, and solve abstract problems, and that pessimists in older age have lower memory ratios. Since cognitive abilities play a significant role in the adult's life, scientists are looking for factors that contribute to their healthy development in childhood. For example, American researchers have found a link between breastfeeding duration and overall abilities, and the authors note that there is no such link with executive function and memory. A group of Chilean scientists have shown that music improves children's memory. Anastasia Lyashenko"

    "translated_title": "The macaques felt their pulse rate.",
    "translated_text": "Biologists have confirmed that macaques can sense their own pulse. In experiments, these primates looked at objects that fluctuated at a higher or lower frequency than their heart rate. But the stimulus, which matched the frequency of the participants' pulses, caused less interest. Similar results have been found in human infants. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. When we're excited or scared, our heart starts beating faster. Animals also have a pulse that is learned during stress, but it is not clear if they experience changes in heart rate as humans do. Neurobiological research confirms that at least the monkeys have the brain structure they need. Experiments with macaques (Macaca mulatta) in the 1960s-1980s showed that they could be taught to slow or speed up their heart rate to avoid being struck by electrical current. However, it is not known whether these and other nonhuman primates can sense their own pulse without prior training. A team of biologists led by Eliza Bliss-Moreau of the California National Primate Research Center decided to address this issue. They decided to test the ability of the macaque to enter the brain using a test that was designed for human infants. The researchers selected four captive-born individuals and trained them to sit quietly on a chair for tests with electrophoric cardiac imaging equipment attached to their chest. Once the macaques were mastered, they were placed in front of the monitor and displayed a video recording of a yellow or pink drop moving up and down the screen. In some tests, the object's motion was synchronized with the heart rate of the experimental animal, while in others, the frequency was ten percent higher or, conversely, lower. When the drop reached the phase corresponding to the R-tooth on the cardiogram, the sound signal was played back. To motivate the monkeys to participate in the experiments, they were rewarded with apple and grape juice. In total, each macaque has passed a hundred tests. During the study, Bliss-Moro and her colleagues recorded the heart rate of the subjects and tracked their eye movements. Based on human studies, the researchers suggested that if macaques feel their own pulse frequency, images that move at a different frequency should be more attractive to them. That prediction has come true. The monkeys looked at asynchronous objects that moved faster and slower than their heart rate, averaging 1.84 seconds and 1.69 seconds respectively. The macaques looked at synchronous stimuli that matched their pulse frequency for an average of 1.01 seconds. Because faster and slower objects attracted about the same amount of attention from monkeys, the researchers concluded that the subjects were not concerned with the absolute speed of the stimulus, but with its deviation from the pulse frequency. Further analysis showed that the results could not be explained by novel asynchronous stimuli or individual differences in heart rate. The difference between the average time that macaques spent looking at asynchronous stimuli and the average time they spent on synchronous stimuli was correlated with the sum of these values as 0.26. This result is very similar to what was previously obtained for human infants (0.2). So macaques can sense the heart rate and relate that information to external information, such as visual and sound stimuli. Bliss-Moro and her co-authors note that people differ markedly from each other in their ability to feel their own pulse. In addition, she is affected by mental health conditions and some diseases. This is probably true for the macaque as well, as the interest in synchronous and asynchronous stimuli varied slightly between individuals. If there were more of these, it might include individuals who look at stimuli with the same interest regardless of their frequency of oscillation, and those who prefer to look at objects that oscillate with their own pulse. The researchers hope that their findings will help them learn more about the evolution of interceptions and how they are affected by various diseases and conditions. The British startup Team Turquoise has launched a device called Doppel. This watch-shaped device gives the wearer's wrist mechanical pulses that resemble the pulse of a radial artery. It was assumed that low-frequency pulses should calm down, and high-frequency pulses should give a sense of alertness. A few years after the launch, the creators of Doppel confirmed that it actually reduces anxiety in stressful situations. Sergei Kelenov"

Currently, all of the observatory's systems are operating normally, and engineers have made the first adjustment to one of the main mirror segments that the micro-meteoroid hit, NASA reports. Micro-meteoroid collisions are a common occurrence for any spacecraft, especially in interplanetary space, and should be taken into account when designing and building it. The new James Webb Space Observatory is no exception, with a huge segmented main mirror and a five-layer heat shielded capton screen. Even during the manufacture of the segments of all mirrors, the resistance of the high-speed micro-meteorids was tested, which showed that they could withstand them. In addition, the observatory can maneuver through a meteorite stream, and a number of important elements such as cables are equipped with thick protective insulation. Since the launch of James Webb late last year, his team has recorded four small collisions with micro-meteoroids that were predicted. However, between May 23 and 25, a micro-meteoroid hit the C3 segment of the main mirror, which proved to be more powerful than the modeled ones, and was not part of the flow, which was unpredictable. Currently, all the observatory systems are operating in normal mode, and engineers have made the first adjustment to the segment. Further adjustments to the position of mirror segments will be made, this will not affect the upcoming work schedule. Currently, James Webb is in a working orbit around the second Lagrange point in the Solar System  Earth and is calibrating scientific instruments  the final stage of commissioning. The first scientific photographs will be delivered to Earth on July 12, 2022. The details of James Webb's birth path and his scientific program can be found in the \"Fly and Watch\" material.

    "translated_title": "A white rotten parasitic fungus has blocked the plant 's defense mechanisms .",
    "translated_text": "American biologists published an article in the journal Nature Communications, which reported on the interaction of a parasitic fungal protein they found with an inhibitor of enzymes that break down the cell walls of plants. This interaction causes the plant's defense mechanisms to stop working, and the fungus continues to parasitize the plant. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a parasitic fungus from the Ascomycota branch. The main feature of this parasite is its ability to form resting structures of sclerosis. These formations give rise to a fruiting body of mushrooms in early spring, which begins to parasitize on the plant. S. Sclerotiorum causes white rot disease (sclerotiniosis). More than 600 species of plants are affected by this disease, including economically important plants such as garden beans and sunflowers. The main symptom of this disease is maceration (solving of intercellular material) of plant tissues. One of the elements of the plant cell wall is pectin. This polysaccharide is mostly made up of the remnants of galacturonic acid. Pectins play an important role in plant growth and fruit formation, but some parasitic fungi, including S. The sclerotorium causes necrosis of the plant tissue, breaking up this polysaccharide. It does this by the enzyme  polygalacturonase (PG), which hydrolyzes pectin, thereby reducing the turgor of the plant. If this process takes a long time, the plant begins to shrink, tissue necrosis occurs and eventually it dies. However, plants have learned to fight parasitic fungi. For this, they synthesize PG-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) that bind reversibly to polygallacturonaze, thus preventing the enzyme from binding to the cell wall. These are proteins that are embedded in the cell wall of plants that protect plants from parasitic fungi. Protection is achieved in two ways: the first is that PGIP reversible binds to PG, inhibiting its function. The second way is that some PG's still reaching their target, which breaks the pectin. One of its breakdown products is oligolacturonides, which are recognized by PGIP as a marker of plant damage, which further activates other plant defense mechanisms. Studying the pathogenicity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Wei Wei of Washington State University and Liangsheng Xu of Northwestern University of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences and Technology and colleagues concluded that this fungus secretes a protein that interacts with the protective structures of an infected plant. Although plants have protective mechanisms, this does not save them from parasitic fungi and further tissue necrosis. To bypass PGIP S, sclerotiorum secrete a protein that has a greater affinity for this protective protein than PG. This protein is called PGIP inactivating effector 1 (PGIP inactivating effector  PINE). The SSPINE1 (S. Scletorotium PINE 1) binds to PGIP instead of polygallacturonidaze, thus occupying an active protective protein center. So it turns out that PG stays active, which in turn leads to the rupture of the plant cell wall and tissue necrosis. To make sure that SsPINE1  is a protein that plays an important role in plant infection, the researchers knocked it out. Such mutant fungi had a low virulence rate compared to non-mutant fungi, which was expressed in less fungal biomass and less necrosis of plant tissue. According to the study's authors, the discovery of PINE expands the range of opportunities for creating PGIPs that are resistant to it and for further extracting plants that are resistant to parasitic fungi. You can learn more about parasitic organisms from our \"Habitat of Evil\" test. In addition, N+1 has previously written about other parasitic fungi and diseases, such as hythridomycosis, which has caused the decline of many amphibian species, and cordiception, which causes ants to change their behavior.

    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have discovered in Navarre a bronze artifact in the form of a human brush, on which is the oldest known inscription in the language of the ancestors of the modern Basques. The first third of the 1st century BC showed that the Vascons used writing before the spread of the Latin alphabet, reports the press release of the Scientific Society of Aransadi. Before the spread of Latin on the Iberian Peninsula, representatives of different ethno-linguistic groups lived there. In addition to the Greeks and Phoenicians who established their colonies here, the descendants of pre-Indo-European settlers, the pre-Celtic Indo-European population (Luzitanes), and the Celts lived in Iberia. The first of these groups is the Vaskons, who are considered the ancestors of modern Basques and are mentioned by ancient authors in their works. The Vascones lived on lands stretching from the Pyrenees Mountains south to the Ebro River valley. Archaeologists have discovered a large number of ancient settlements, including fortified settlements. Their economy was based on grain cultivation and livestock. The animals were mainly sheep, goats, cows, pigs and horses. Besides, the Vascons were familiar with bronze and iron metallurgy, and also engaged in trade. A group of archaeologists from the Aransadi Scientific Society has been excavating an ancient settlement since 2017, which was discovered about eight kilometers from the city of Pamplona (Navarra province). According to researchers, people began living here in the Bronze Age (about the 15th and 11th centuries BC) and continued to do so until the 1st century BC. Last summer, at the entrance to one of the houses destroyed during the Sertorian War, archaeologists discovered an unusual human brush-shaped artifact of a natural size made of a bronze sheet a little over a millimeter thick. Its size is 143.1×127.9 millimeters, and its weight reaches 35.9 grams. According to researchers, in ancient times, this object hung on the entrance door. However, the main value of this find was realized this year when restorers worked on it. It turned out that on the bronze brush was an inscription of five words (40 characters) created over two thousand years ago. According to researchers, the artifact dates to the first third of the 1st century BC and is the oldest text written in the language of the Vascons. This discovery confirmed that the Basque ancestors had their own writing. So far, researchers have only understood one word  sorioneku, which in modern Basque corresponds to the word zorioneko, meaning good luck or good fortune. Previously, N+1 was talking about other archaeological finds made in Spain. For example, freedmen came across a treasure trove of ancient Roman gold coins in the bay of Havea at the end of the 4th  beginning of the 5th century AD. And during excavations in the province of Cordoba, researchers discovered a half-meter-high ancient Roman fallos carved into the building."

    "translated_title": "Physicists have clarified the isotopic shift of the g-factor of a hydrogen-like neon",
    "translated_text": "Physicists from Germany and Russia have performed a superpolar measurement of the isotopic shift of the electron magnetic moment in hydrogen-like neon ions. The joint measurement of the pair of isotopes in the Penning trap allowed to significantly reduce errors and bring the relative accuracy of measuring the difference in their g-factors to 5,6 × 10−13. The study was published in Nature. When it comes to the ratio of the size of an atom to its nucleus, a football stadium is often compared, with a pear in the middle. If you look at the distance between the electron and the nucleus, you can see the last point. This approach proved fruitful: early in the 20th century, at the dawn of atomic physics, physicists considered the nucleus to be pointed, and the newly created quantum mechanics were doing well with the results of experiments of that era. The approximation of the dot core remained satisfactory even when accounting for the interaction between the orbital motion of the electron and its spin, as well as the relativistic effects, was required. However, advances in experimental physics soon began to expose the finer atomic effects. These include the end of the mass of the nucleus, which results in the yield effect, and the end of its size, which is expressed in the non-precise distribution of electric charge and magnetism. The end of the atomic nucleus (primarily hydrogen) was the point of incompatibility between the two groups of experiments, which was called the \"proton radius puzzle\". We have dedicated a separate article on this issue, \"Shares in Armour\", and are actively monitoring its resolution. The size limit of the nucleus is also of interest to physicists. In addition to the energy level shift, this results in the subtlest change in the electron's response to the magnetic field, which is characterized by its magnetic moment, expressed through the Land factor or g-factor. The detection of this effect when measuring the properties of single ions is possible, but it suffers from accuracy because the end of the mass sinks against the background of many other quantum electrodynamic (KED) effects. For this reason, a group of physicists from the Max Planck Society's Institute of Nuclear Physics, led by Andrey Volotka of the MIT, measured the g-factors of two hydrogen-like ions, the nuclei of which were the isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne. By placing the ions in identical conditions and measuring the difference in their magnetic moments, the scientists were able to rule out all other effects that were not related to the yield of the nucleus. This allowed two orders of magnitude greater accuracy of experimental access to the isotopic shift compared to previous measurements. Physicists are making a precise determination of the Lande charge factor by making it spin and oscillate in the magnetic fields of Penning's traps. In this state, scientists apply a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (electronic or nuclear, depending on the magnetic moment they are interested in) to them, extracting from it the vibration frequency that is associated with the Lande factor through charge and particle mass, as well as the cyclotron frequency of oscillations. That's how another group of physicists at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics measured the magnetic moment of helium-3 ions. The main source of errors is the measurement errors of ions and electrons. Since the isotopic effect  is very thin, it is difficult to distinguish against the background of these uncertainties if the g-factors of the ions are measured separately. In addition, magnetic field fluctuations also cause large errors on the time scales needed to measure cyclotron frequency. The wire and its colleagues overcame all these difficulties by combining the 20Ne9+ and 22Ne9+ ions inside the trap into a pair of bonded pairs called an ion crystal. As in their colleagues' research, physicists used two traps: the analytical  with a high magnetic field gradient  and the measuring  with a maximum homogeneity field. The first was required to separate ions with different projections of the spine, the second was required to measure the luminous frequency. The ionic bonding made their trapping difficult. It can be thought of as the rotation of a pair around a common center, which in turn revolves around the axis of the trap. The authors could change all the parameters of the movement. In particular, they varied the distance between the ions in the range of several hundred micrometers. A notable feature of this system was that the bond between the ions led to a coherent interaction of their spines. Because the main source of decogeneration in the experiment was magnetic field fluctuations, and the ions experienced them simultaneously, the paired coherence time of the spins was 20 times greater than the coherence time of the individual spins and was 2.2 seconds. Physicists used this to produce a Ramsay interferometry over polarized backward ions, which, with some probability, led to their reversals. By closely interacting with the probability of such a turn over time, the authors extracted the difference in the noise frequencies with high accuracy, and hence the electronic g-factors. In this way, physicists found that the isotopic shift of the electron g-factor for hydrogen-like neon ions was 13.47524 ((53) exp ((99) sys×10−9, which was in good agreement with the theoretical value of 13.474 ((11) ×10−9. Since the calculation of this quantity involves the difference in the average square charge radii of both isotopes, experience will allow us to clarify this constant, which is equal to 0.0533(4) femtometers, which is more accurate than the then-commonly accepted value. The results of the physicists' work will limit the circle of theories seeking a fifth force in the form of new particles that modify interactions between nuclei and electrons. In addition, their work will help in future measurements of the g-factor of heavy ions and a more accurate definition of a constant thin structure. The comparative measurement of Lande's factors allows us to look for other subtle effects. We've written about how in a similar setup, CERN physicists compared protons to antiprotons. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "The in vitro tear gland organide successfully cultured in rats",
    "translated_text": "Japanese biologists successfully transplanted a tear gland organide from multiple epithelial cells of the eye into a rat. According to Nature, this organoid is similar to tear glands in morphology, immune markers, and expression of certain genes. The tear gland is the main exocrine gland of the eye. It secretes tear fluid, the most important component of the tear film, and various protective proteins, such as lactoferrin, a lysosome that is involved in antimicrobial protection. The cells of the fetal tear gland are capable of regeneration, but in adults this activity is minimal. It's hard to study this gland because the organ is not available for biopsy and cell differentiation. So iron is a target for drug development and regenerative therapy research. Ryuhei Hayashi and Toru Okubo of Osaka University's Higher Medical School in 2017 shared with colleagues their creation of the self-formed ectodermal autonomous multi-zone eye organid SEAM. SEAM partially replicated the mechanisms of development of the present eye and contained precursor cells for the eye's cell lines. Now they've published an article about a tear gland organide that's grown from SEAM cells. By the tenth week of SEAM development, cells that developed in the third zone began to produce eye and gland markers. Some of the cells that released the iron markers began to twitch and branch weakly. To determine whether these cells are precursors to the tear gland organids, the researchers isolated them and cultured them in an environment that contains key growth factors for the gland cells. On the fourth day of development in the new environment, the cells began to splinter, on the fifteenth, several branches formed, and 39 days later, a three-dimensional structure similar to the tear gland tissue formed. Based on this, the researchers concluded that the cells in the third SEAM zone, which contain cells on the eye's surface, give rise to the tear gland organide. The researchers then decided to find out which cells from the third SEAM zone were the precursors of the tear gland organide. For this, they used a method of flow cytometry with the addition of antibodies that interact with the eye's stem epithelial cells (anti-ITGB4, anti-SSEA-4, and anti-CD200). The analysis found that 90 percent of the cells were negative for CD200, while 60 percent were positive for ITGB4, and SSEA-4. All of these characteristics are related to the stem cells of the eye. So the researchers concluded that the cells that formed the tear gland organide were in the line of the eye's stem cells. The authors then analyzed the entire SEAM and found that about 70 percent were positive for CD200, and four cell populations were identified from the remaining CD200. These populations were then moved to the environment for further cultivation, and only one of them formed a multi-ageed form. So the researchers decided that this cell line is the precursor to the tear gland organids. After selecting the optimal environment for the branching and puncture of glands from this cell line, the researchers analyzed the single-chain RNA of these cells. He showed that at 20 days of development, the cells began to synthesize the functional proteins of the tear glands: lipocalin-2 and β-defenzine. In addition, large clusters of cells, such as myoepithelial, acinar, and protocytes, have formed. To test the hypothesis that the precursors of the tear gland evolved from the stem cells of the eye, biologists conducted a microscopic study of the structure of the colony and identified two cell types: flat and dome-shaped. By studying genes associated with the development of glands, researchers found that they are more expressed in dome-shaped cells. Also, knockout of one of these genes showed a decrease in the splenic artery and branching in the glands. The reverse was observed in flat cells: there were more markers of the cells that preceded the cornea. These data suggest that the original hypothesis about the origin of the tear gland's predecessors was true. After the researchers grew the tear gland organide they transplanted it into connective tissue near the rat's eye. Four weeks after the operation, the transplanted organ has been preserved and formed a structure similar to a canal. Unlike in vitro organids, transplanted ones showed a clear pattern of prototypes in the second week, and they became more pronounced in the fourth. Lactoferrin-producing cells that could not be detected in vitro were found in some parts of the transplanted organide. An analysis of gene expression after transplantation showed that in transplanted people, the expression of LYZ and LTF genes (coding tear film proteins) increased by 3,000 times compared to non-transplanted ones. Based on the data, biologists concluded that the expression of certain genes and markers in the transplanted organide and the native tear gland is the same. According to the authors, the data and successful transplantation open up prospects for studies of the development of the tear gland and the treatment of certain diseases, such as Shegren's syndrome. In addition, these grown organoids can be used in the development of medicines and in the study of tear gland pathologies. We've been talking about a group of scientists in Switzerland who claimed to have developed a bioprinting method that allows them to print large organs. Ismail Yunusov"

    "translated_title": "Imitating edible items has protected animals from predators better than other forms of disguise .",
    "translated_text": "A meta-analysis of 84 studies has shown that mimicking non-eaten items, such as leaves or branches, is the most effective protective dye in animals. To find the predator's hidden prey, it takes 300 percent more time than the victims without camouflage. Other types of protective dye, such as protective or dismembering dye, are much less effective. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Many animals use their color to protect them from predators. Some of them merge with the background by means of protective coloring, while others are contrasted in contrast tones that break the body contours into separate sections. Another common way to confuse an enemy is to pretend to be an unedible object, such as a branch, leaf, or even a pile of bird droppings. Although a variety of animal-based protective paints have been well documented, their effectiveness has not been studied. In particular, until now, almost no one had compared which camouflage types best protect against predators. A team of zoologists led by Juan Vitor de Alcantara Viana of Campinas University decided to solve this problem. Using Web of Science databases and Google Scholar search engine, researchers found 1,188 references to a variety of protective dyes, from protective to imitative, inedible objects and false eyes, in the scientific literature published from 1900 to 2022. They then selected 84 articles that tested the effectiveness of camouflage experimentally, in particular how much time predators spend on covert prey and what percentage of masked animals are attacked by predators. The meta-analysis showed that protective paint really protects animals from enemies. On average, it increases the time a predator takes to find a prey by 62.57 percent. In addition, the protective paint reduces the number of individuals attacked by predators by 27.34 percent. The most effective strategy to protect against enemies was to imitate the unedible objects. It causes predators to spend 295.43 percent more time searching for hidden prey. For protective and dismembering dyes, the values of this indicator are approximately equal and equal to 56.63 and 52.75 percent respectively. By comparison, false eyes and camouflage of movement do not affect the time it takes a predator to detect a victim. Masking also reduces the number of individuals attacked by predators. Protective paint reduces the number of attacks by 22.69 percent, dismembering paint by 18.73 percent, and camouflage by 29.99 percent. Cataracts are the most successful protective dye. Predators spend 279.49 percent more time looking for masked butterfly lice than they do in control. Also, caterpillars with camouflage flowering are 30.8 percent less likely to be attacked by birds and other predators. The results of the study confirm the benefits of protective dyes. They also show that animals that imitate unedible objects are best protected from predators. However, this camouflage option, despite its effectiveness, is not suitable for all types. It can only be used by small creatures that match in size with imitation objects. Protective dye is used not only by animals but also by some plants. For example, the fritilaria delavayi, a plant native to the mountains of southwestern China, has acquired a masking brownish-grey coloring of the leaves that helps it hide from the eyes of humans. This adaptation can save them from the intense bulb harvesting for the needs of Chinese medicine. In areas where it is difficult to extract the leaves, they remain green. Sergei Kelenov"

    "translated_title": "Falcon Heavy superheavy rocket made its first flight in three years",
    "translated_text": "SpaceX launched a superheavy Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time in three years as part of the USSF-44 mission for the US Space Force. At least two satellites have been launched into geostationary orbit. The side accelerators landed after launch, and the central unit did not return to land this time. The broadcast was on Youtube. Falcon Heavy is a two-stage rocket-carrier from SpaceX, which differs from the Falcon 9 rocket in having a pair of reversible side-accelerators based on the design of its first stage. The rocket is equipped with 27 Merlin engines and can deliver up to 63.8 tons of payload to low Earth orbit and up to 26.7 tons to geolocation orbit. The first flight of the Falcon Heavy took place in February 2018, when the Tesla Roadster with a mannequin inside was a useful payload. Two commercial launches followed, the last of which was in 2019. The fourth Falcon Heavy flight and first flight to geostationary orbit under the USSF-44 program took place on November 1, 2022 from the Kennedy Space Center's LC-39A launch complex. Such a large break in launches is due to delays in preparing the payload  Initially the launch was planned for 2020. The USSF-44 mission was under contract to the US Space Force. The payload is classified, but it is known to have a total mass of about 3,7 tons and consists of at least two spacecraft, one of which is the military TETRA-1 microsatellite. The mission used new side-accelerators that then landed on landing sites, as well as a central unit that was not returnable this time. The creatures of the head of the outflow were successfully caught from the ocean by a search vessel. A few hours after launch, the satellites separated from the second stage of the rocket, successfully completing the flight. SpaceX is now focused on developing its second superheavy rocket, the Starship. Its prototype has passed high-altitude atmospheric tests, the rocket in full assembly has already been tested with gasoline on the launch pad, and the first flight into orbit could take place as early as December this year."

The project was originally scheduled to end in 2023, Spacenews reports. I'm not going to. SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy), developed by NASA and DLR, began its work in 2010 as the successor to the Kuiper Observatory. It is a modified wide-body Boeing 747SP aircraft, which houses a 2.7-meter infrared telescope. The useful load consists of seven scientific instruments. Observations are made when the observatory is 12-14 kilometers above the Earth's stratosphere. SOFIA studies the star formation and interstellar environment of the Milky Way, solar system objects, exoplanets, remnants of supernovae and other galaxies. Back in 2019, NASA concluded that the observatory was not very efficient, but the project continued to exist. However, the authors of a new 10-year NASA astrophysical review recommended that the project be completed in 2023, and recently the agency decided not to allocate money for it in 2023. However, on April 28, NASA and DLR announced that the observatory would be shut down this year  this will happen no later than September 30. So far, SOFIA has 70 more flights, of which more than 30 will be in New Zealand. Not all of the more than a hundred previously approved observatory observation programs will be completed by the end of September, with their future to be announced later. We've talked about how SOFIA found water molecules in a crater on the visible side of the moon and proved the presence of molecular ions of HeH+, which were the first molecules in the universe, in outer space.

    "translated_title": "In Italy, found wooden serpents more than 7,000 years old",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists presented the results of a study of three wooden serpents discovered during underwater excavations of the early Neolithic monument of La Marmotta in Italy. It turns out that these tools were made more than 7,000 years ago from oak and wood, which belong to the rose family. As a glue for cementing stone deposits, the ancient people used resin from pine trees. This is reported in an article published in the journal Scientific Reports. Grain harvesting tools were developed long before domestication. Thus, if the process of transition from the appropriating to the producing (neolitizing) in several centers of the Fertile Crescent began no later than X millennium BC, then the Serbian predecessors already existed during the time of the last glaciation. Several years ago, during the exploration of the Ohallo-II monument in Israel, which was a camp of hunter-gatherers-fishermen on the seafront, archaeologists discovered the remains of composite tools with traces of wear and tear, which are about 23,000 years old. The Natufian culture was founded about 14,000 years ago with a deer horn. In the early 7th millennium BC, the first Anatolian farmers began to enter Greece and the Balkans, bringing not only pottery, domestic plants and animals, but also a distinctive set of tools to the European continent. One of the ancient monuments associated with early European farmers was discovered under the waters of Lake Brachchano, located near Rome. Underwater exploration of the settlement, which was named La Marmotta, produced a rich collection of finds, among which are objects made of organic materials more than seven thousand years old, such as five double-boats (canoes). Niccolo Mazzucco of the University of Pisa, together with colleagues from Argentina, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, has investigated three of the best-preserved wooden serpents found during excavations of the early Neolithic monument of La Marmot. Although underwater excavations of the settlement were stopped in 2006, the findings were not published. Radiocarbon dating has shown that the cultural layers of this monument date from about 75707165 years ago. The first nine-stone saw was found in 2000. Its handle measures 8.5 by 1.8 by 1.2 centimetres, and the curved cutting part is 18.5 by 4.5 by 1.2 centimetres. The second saw with eight embeddings was discovered in 2005. Its handle was 18 x 2 x 1,6 cm, and the blade was curved  18,2 x 4,2 x 1,2. The third artifact with three envelopes was found in 1996. Its handle was 9×5,9×1,3 centimetres, and its curved blade was 16.5 x 3 x 1.1. Scientists noted that Neolithic serpents were noticeably smaller in length than those used in historical times. But by this indicator, they resemble horned tools of about 7,500 to 8,200 years old found in Bulgaria. Microscopic analysis showed that there were traces of wear on all three serp. It seems that the Neolithic settlers of La Marmotta cut the plant from the root with these tools, leaving behind a distinctive trace on the stone enclosures. According to the scientists, the raw material for making two serps was oak wood (Quercus), for another  taxon wood from the family of rose trees (Rosaceae). This raw material was used in the settlement of La Marmotta and for other manufacturing. Using gas chromatography  mass spectrometry, the researchers determined that resin from pine trees (Pinaceae) was present on all three instruments, which served as a glue. Paleobotanical research has shown that micro-residues of wheat (Triticum) and barley (Hordeum) are present on two serps. This confirms that the tools were used for harvesting. On the third serpent, researchers unexpectedly found a lot of pollination from the plant genus Oenanthe. Some species of plants in this genus, according to scientists, have pharmacological properties and are used as medicinal plants. In addition, these plants have a psychoactive effect. The pollen may reflect the plants that were cut by the serpent when last used. But it could also be due to the conditions of precipitation accumulation on this monument. Recently, N+1 was talking about other research on the Neolithic era in Europe. So, bioarchaeologists have figured out the diet of the first Greek farmers. And paleontologists have discovered that the Balkan herders of the new Stone Age hunted for the coyote. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "An American woman had a 3D-printed ear canal implanted .",
    "translated_text": "American doctors implanted a 20-year-old girl with microwave ear cancers, printed on a 3D bioprint from the cells of the patient's own ear cartilage. The surgery was performed as part of clinical trials of the AuriNovo implant. This is reported in a press release from 3DBio Therapeutics. Microtomy is an inherited developmental abnormality characterized by partial or complete absence of the ear canal or one of its parts. It is usually associated with the absence (atresia) of the external auditory pathway, and in about a third of cases  with underdevelopment of the facial part of the skeleton, such as the lower jaw. The frequency of this anomaly is different in different populations. Scientists report that it ranges from 0.83 to 17.4 cases per 10,000 newborns. It is thought that microtia is more common in Latinos, Asians, Native Americans, and Andean peoples. The problem of reconstructing the ear canal occupies a special place in reconstructive surgery, which is explained by the complexity of the relief, the presence of a thin cartilage plate between the layers of the skin, as well as the features of attachment to the skull. It requires at least a supporting frame and a covering material. The first is often made from the patient's own rib crab, which can be complicated by various complications. However, a few years ago, scientists introduced a bioprinting machine that prints from living cells of human tissue that can maintain their shape and fit into the body. The earplugs he made, planted into mice, remained in shape for two months. Testing of such implants in humans was also planned to begin with ear cancers, since cartilage does not require a large blood vessel system. The regenerative medicine company 3DBio Therapeutics and the Microtia-Congenital Ear Deformity Institute announced that they had transplanted an AuriNovo 3D-bioprinted implant into a 20-year-old girl named Alex, who suffered from congenital ear canal deformity. As a material for its manufacture, scientists used the patient's own cells (chondrocytes) to grow them in a laboratory setting, taking a fragment of her ear's cartilage tissue. To make the implant fit the shape of a healthy ear canal, the researchers took a 3D scan of the patient's left ear. The implantation procedure itself was performed by a team of doctors led by Arturo Bonilla, founder and director of the Micromia Institute in San Antonio. According to Bonilla, he hopes that the new technology can replace modern surgical techniques for ear canal reconstruction, where implants are made of rib clay or porous polyethylene. The operation was reportedly conducted as part of clinical trial phase 1/2a, in which researchers will gather data on the safety of the procedure and its effectiveness. The trials are expected to involve 11 patients from Los Angeles and San Antonio. Earlier, N+1 reported that American scientists had printed artificial analogues of coronary and femoral vessels, the heart and other complex biological structures on a regular 3D printer. And researchers in Switzerland have created a fully functional artificial heart. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "Paleontologists described the largest mega-raptor, about 10 meters long.",
    "translated_text": "Paleontologists have described a new predatory dinosaur from the mega-raptor group, whose fossil remains were found in Argentine deposits between 72.1 and 66 million years old. The dinosaur was named Maip macrothorax. It was 910 metres long, making it the largest representative of the mega-raptor. This discovery confirms the hypothesis that the evolution of the mega-raptors was on the path of increasing body size. The study was published in Scientific Reports. Megaraptors (Megaraptora) are a group of predatory dinosaurs that lived in the small period in Australia, Asia and South America. Compared to other large theropods, mega-raptors had long and powerful front limbs with large claws. The kinship of this group has long been a matter of contention among paleontologists. Recently, more and more data have been emerging to support the claim that mega-raptors are part of the cellurosauria (Coelurosauria)  group, which unites dinosaurs such as tyrannosaurs, velociraptors, and birds. The new representative of the mega-raptors was described by paleontologists from Argentina and Japan led by Alexis Aransiag Rolando (Alexis M. Aranciaga Rolando) from the Museum of Natural Sciences named after Bernardino Rivadavia. The fossils of the dinosaur were found in the Argentine Chorrillo Formation, which is between 72.1 and 66 million years old (maaustrхт). Scientists have named the new mega-raptor Maip macrothorax. The genus name is in honor of the evil spirit of the mythology of theueelche, who was represented as \"the shadow of death, killing by the cold wind\". The species name translates as \"big chest cell\"  the width of its chest cavity was 120 centimeters. Interestingly, in the mythology of the Tewel, this spirit has a no less formidable brother, Kellenken, who was depicted as a giant bird of prey. It is named after another notable extinct organism  Kelenken guillermoi from the furry-haired family (Phorusrhacidae), which are called \"terrible birds\". It is the largest known member of the family: its skull was almost 72 centimetres long (the largest skull among birds), and its height was  three metres. The new species was the largest known mega-raptor: its length was estimated at 910 meters. Another feature was that many of the spines and ribs had a characteristic exhaustion, which scientists interpreted as the places of attachment of ligaments. The researchers suggested that these bonds could provide advanced rib breathing movements (a similar pattern is observed in the tyrannosaurid). Scientists conducted a phylogenetic analysis that showed that the megaraptors are a sister group to tyrannosaurids. According to the data obtained, South American mega-raptors form two monophyletic trunks: A and B, with the second trunks being deposited in the first. Many members of Class A were six or more feet long, and the members of Class B, which had a new species, were more than eight feet long. This means that during evolution, the size of the mega-raptors increased, as previously thought. It is noteworthy that the increase in mega-raptor size coincides with the extinction of the carcharodontozaurid  of large predatory dinosaurs. It is likely that in Laramida (the western part of North America) the karharodontosaurid was replaced by the tyrannosaurid, and in South America by the megalaptors, as well as the abelizaurid, among which the cornosaur is known for its horns. We've written about another mega-raptor, Murusraptor barrosaensis, which we also found in Argentina, but in older deposits. The Seed of Frost"

    "translated_title": "The burial of an ancient Russian military elite was excavated near Sudzal",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists reported the results of excavations of two ancient Russian tombs found in the Suzdal Opole. In one of them, scientists found the remains of a man belonging to a military elite, who was buried alongside a battle axe in the XI century. Another burial site contained the remains of a woman whose accompanying inventory included three-bussed Slavonic rings and a volga-Finnish noisy pendant-conek. This is reported in the press release of the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The Suzdal expedition of the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the State Historical Museum has been searching for medieval tombs in the Suzdal Opole, explored by Count Alexey Uvarov in 18511852. After years of excavation and land reclamation, these burial sites have lost their rugged hills and are now invisible to the naked eye. Such tombs can be found by GIS technology and geophysical imaging. Many years of excavation of the burial complex in Shekshowo have shown that the tombs that were previously considered to be fully explored have preserved elements of a spatial organization, intact burials and numerous inventory. The most significant achievement in this direction was the re-opening of the Gnezdilo-12 cemetery, located near the village of the same name near Suzdal. In the mid-19th century, according to field logs and plans, the complex included at least 83 notable mounds, 81 of which were excavated. The monument was the first to be dedicated to cremation and inhumation with a rich accompanying inventory. During two recent field seasons, archaeologists have collected 245 medieval objects, including spikes, noisy jewelry, coins and fragments of belt sets, mostly from the XXII centuries. Researchers from the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the State Historical Museum reported on the new results of the studies of medieval tombs discovered in the Suzdal Opole. For example, on the Gnezilo-12, discovered in 2019 with the help of GIS technologies and geophysical methods, archaeologists laid two new excavations, in which they discovered burials of the XI century, performed according to the ritual of ingestion. A total of ten tombs were surveyed on the site, most of which appear to have been women. The found ornaments include a chest ring, a glass beam, and necklace hangings. In addition, the accompanying inventory of these people also included iron knives and ceramic vessels. Archaeologists have noticed two burials from the Gnezdylovo-12 cemetery. In one of them they found a characteristic Volga-Finnish decoration with a noisy Meryan or Vladimir type pendant. Although similar items were found during excavations in the 19th century, in recent decades they have not been found in the cemeteries of the Suzdal Opole. In the same burial ground, three-bussy stocking rings were found, which were characteristic of the Slavic women's costume. In another grave pit, scientists apparently found the remains of a man with a battle axe. Anna Krasnikova of the State Historical Museum noted that weapons are rarely found in ancient Russian tombs, so each such find becomes the object of close attention. In the past two seasons, archaeologists have discovered six battle axes on this monument. According to them, this indicates that the dead belonged to the military elite, perhaps to the local nobility or princely friends who may have participated in the struggle of the representatives of the Ruriković dynasty for the Suzdal. In addition, archaeologists have explored the Necropolis of Selzo, where nine of the ten visible gurgans were excavated in 1851. Geophysical imaging of the monument has revealed 40 rounded anomalies that may represent curgans. Today, scientists have found more than 150 artifacts from the ruined burial sites, including three battle axes, the Byzantine miliarice of Vasily II (977-989), the emperor Otto III's denarius (983-1002) and two eastern coins. In addition, scientists were able to find numerous elements of men's belts, women's clothing, such as bracelets, rings and pendants, as well as a circular scarf pendulum, which belongs to the Scandinavian jewellery circle. Recently, N + 1 has been talking about other archaeological excavations at ancient Russian monuments. In Novgorod, scientists found a gold seal and five ribbon bars, one of which mentioned salmon, trout and a box of ivory. And in Gnezdo, a silver knitted posement was discovered, an element of the clothes of the ancient Russian nobility. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "The tooth of an Italian child points to the seasonal mobility of late-Paleolithic saw hunters",
    "translated_text": "Paleontologists have investigated a milk molar found in northeastern Italy during excavations of the Paradis monument, and found that it belonged to a boy of 1112 years old who lived about 1308812897 years ago. The strontium isotope ratio showed that this child was born in another region, but apparently annually found himself in the area of the Paradise Caves during seasonal migrations of epigrave hunter-gatherers, whose main prey were the alpine squirrels. This is reported in an article published in the journal Scientific Reports. In the late Paleolithic era, when the last glaciation (about 2120 thousand years ago) was not yet complete, the epigrave archaeological culture developed in Italy and on the Adriatic coast of the Balkan Peninsula, which became a continuation of the gravet culture. The first monuments of this culture were discovered in Italy at the end of the 19th century. Its distinctive features are the microstrews with a dulled edge of the ________ for the bone tips of the copies. In the Predalpas, located in the northeast of Italy in the Friuli-Venice-Julian region, are the Grottoes of the Pradis. Despite the presence of a large number of paleontological and archaeological materials, in 1962 the monument was adapted for tourist visits, which led to the loss of a large amount of information. Studies have shown that during the Middle Paleolithic period, the area was inhabited by Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). However, most of the finds date back to much later times  to the late Paleolithic, when the caves were occupied by the epigravet culture. A study of more than 11,000 animal remains revealed that these people hunted mostly alpine squirrels (Marmota marmota). Using radiocarbon analysis of animal bones, scientists have determined that ancient hunter-gatherers were present at this monument about 13,912,6 thousand years ago. Stefano Benazzi of the University of Bologna, together with colleagues from Britain, Germany, Italy and France, has investigated a milk tooth found in the epigravet cultural layer of the Pradis monument. Scientists took a microtomy of this finding to build a three-dimensional model, performed a morphological analysis, and also examined the tooth's incision using the mass spectrometry method with inductively bound plasma with laser ablation (LA-MC-ICPMS) to obtain information about the ratio of strontium isotopes 87Sr/86Sr. They also took a small sample of tooth enamel for proteomic analysis, and they also got a direct radiocarbon dating. Paleontologists noted that during excavations of the epigrave cultural layers, in addition to tools, there were found faunistic remains. They included the bones of large deer (Cervidae): elk (Alces alces) and noble deer (Cervus elaphus), as well as goats (Caprinae): alpine mountain goats (Capra ibex) and sulfur (Rupicapra rupicapra). However, the main object of the late Paleolithic people's hunt was the alpine sourc, which accounts for 99 percent of the bone remains (minimum number of individuals  637). The examined tooth was the lower right second milk mole, which fell out of the baby at about 1112. Protein analysis showed that this individual was probably a boy. Radiocarbon analysis has shown that the age of this find is about 1289713088 years. The relationship of the strontium isotopes showed that the boy's mother was late in pregnancy and he himself lived for the first year of his life away from the Pradis monument. Scientists have concluded that this group of epigraphist hunter-gatherers lived in at least two different regions during the year and probably migrated seasonally. According to the researchers, the Pradesh was a seasonal camp where ancient people came to hunt and divide turkeys. It was probably in September or October, when these animals accumulated large amounts of fat before going to bed in winter. Previously on N+1, they said that in the Italian cave of Romanelli, they found a human bone that lived about 1388611188 years ago. And in the Natural History Museum of the University of Florence, 80 years later, they found the remains of two babies who lived about 12,800 to 11,800 years ago. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "The gold-plated Roman auras were buried in Britain before the Roman conquest",
    "translated_text": "British archaeologist Adrian Marsden reported the findings of a treasure found a few years ago in Norfolk County. The most valuable finds were ten Roman gold coins of the Aures, minted during the reign of Octavian Augustus. The researcher believes that the treasure was unearthed in the early first century C.E., a couple of decades before the Roman conquest of Britain began. He estimates that this amount is equivalent to a legionnaire's two-year salary. This is reported in an article published in The Searcher magazine. In Russia, it is forbidden to conduct field archaeological research without a special permit of an open sheet. Moreover, for using technical search engines, such as metal detectors or radar, the offender is punished more severely. This restriction seems necessary because archaeologists consider not only the artifact itself (even if it eventually reaches them, rather than remaining in a private collection), but also the context in which it was found. Amateur searches are characterized by the irreversible destruction of monuments and cultural layers, which, by the way, can lie literally a few centimeters from the modern surface. But this is not the case in all countries. For example, amateur archaeology is thriving in Denmark, where a significant part of the valuable finds date back to the Viking era (1, 2, 3). They're looking for antiquities and people in Britain. For example, last year, it was reported that British woman Cat Giles had found the fourth Viking treasure in three years on the Isle of Man. Adrian Marsden of Oxford University presented the findings of a treasure hunt that was found a few years ago in Norfolk, England. In 2017, near the city of Norridge, Damon and Denise Pai discovered an ancient coin, followed by new artifacts: more than a hundred Roman copper coins minted in the first three centuries of our era, two denarii, several Roman brochs, and an ancient stater. Aerial photography at the site showed that a coffin was probably built at this site in the Bronze Age, which was later used to store coins. The main finds are coins that were scattered on a small area. According to Marsden, there is no doubt that they were originally a single treasure. It consisted of the auras of ancient Roman gold coins issued during the reign of the first Roman emperor Octavian Augustus (27 BC 14 AD). All coins were minted in the city of Lungdum (now French Lyon). To date, ten such artifacts have been discovered, and Marsden believes there will be more. The original container of these coins may be underground. The archaeologist suggests that the treasure was unearthed in the early years of the 1st century CE, about a generation before the Roman conquest of Britain (43 CE). At that time, Norfolk was home to the Celtic Icenes, whose leader was an ally of Rome in the early 1st century. The scholar noted that Roman gold coins rarely made their way into East England even after the island was conquered. According to him, the ten auras found are comparable to the nine auras that a legionary received in the middle of the 1st century as an annual salary. But the last ones were forced to spend about five coins on food, equipment, and other things because of supply cuts. The treasure was thus found to be about the equivalent of a soldier's two-year salary. Previously on N+1, we've been talking about other bright discoveries made in Britain. For example, an amateur archaeologist and fan of Indiana Jones movies has discovered a treasure trove of 748 gold and silver coins in the vicinity of Ipswich. And in Norfolk County, they found the largest deposit of Anglo-Saxon gold coins. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "Scottish foxes ate dog feces.",
    "translated_text": "Zoologists have found that foxes in the North Highlands regularly eat dog droppings. They feed most actively on them during periods with low numbers of fields  their main production. And just 300 to 600 grams of dog meat is enough to power a fox for a day. As noted in an article in the journal Ecology and Evolution, foxes have not been observed to feed on dog droppings. Some animals are reluctant to eat the excrement of other species. For example, the larvae of the carnivorous beetles (Scarabaeinae) feed primarily on the mammals. Many seabirds occasionally eat the feces of whales, rays, and white bears, and stray dogs in India and Africa are eager to feed on human excrement. In addition, scientists have recently discovered that black-billed ducks (Ochotona curzoniae) from the Tibetan highlands eat more than a litter of eggs in the winter. This energy-rich, easily available food helps them survive the harshest months of the year without falling asleep or stocking up. A similar example was described by a team of zoologists led by Xavier Lambin of the University of Aberdeen. In 2018-2019, researchers studied the diet of predatory mammals in the Cairngorms National Park in the North of Scotland Highlands. To do this, they collected animal feces and analyzed the spinal cord DNA in them by using metabarcoding. In total, the sample included more than 2000 samples of the common fox (Vulpes vulpes), the barsock (Meles meles), the forested coon (Martes martes), as well as the mountain-tailed (Mustela erminea) and the lace (M. The name of the game is Nivalis . After studying 647 fox specimens, the authors found that 55.2 percent of the samples contained genetic material from the dark-field (Microtus agrestis)  of the widespread and numerous rodents that feed many of the North Highlands' predators. However, 39.1 percent of the samples were unexpectedly found to contain DNA from domestic dogs. For comparison, when studying 1,060 samples of woodland coconut tar, researchers found traces of field DNA in 56.51 percent of them, and in dog DNA in 0.85 percent. The encounter of dog and field DNA in the fox's litter varied from season to season. So in the winter of 2018, the average chance of detecting DNA from a dog in samples collected was 0.24. In the spring of 2018, winter of 2019, and spring of 2019, this probability was much higher than  0.39; 0.49; and 0.48, respectively. I'm not going to say anything. The average chance of detecting the DNA of a fox's litter in the winter of 2018 was 0.93. After that, it dropped significantly and in the spring of 2018 it was 0.68, in the winter of 2019 it was 0.19, and in the spring of 2019 it was 0.36. The more DNA found in the fox, the less likely it was to be found in the dog. The simplest explanation for the presence of dog DNA in nearly half of the fox's specimens is that foxes eat dog droppings that are wandered by numerous visitors to the national park. It should be noted that zoologists have never recorded such behavior before. However, the alternative hypotheses seem far less likely. For example, foxes obviously don't hunt dogs. In theory, they could have gotten a dog's DNA from a fall, but in that case, a lot of dogs would have to die in the study area. Some of the dog's DNA probably got into the fox's memory because the dogs urinated on it or rode in it while walking. However, this does not explain why the likelihood of finding dog genetic material in fox feces varies from season to season and correlates negatively with the chances of detecting the DNA of the fox. The number of dark fields, like many other small rodents, fluctuates greatly from year to year. Researchers suggested that in periods when the prey was low, such as the spring of 2018, winter of 2019, and spring of 2019, foxes would switch to feeding on dog droppings. However, it was unclear how energy-efficient such a feed source is. To test this, the authors analyzed the feces of six domestic dogs in a calorie meter. It turns out that on average, dog food contains 135 kilocalories per 100 grams of raw weight. This is comparable to the energy value of small rodents, which is 137170 kilocalories per 100 grams. Scientists estimate that 300 to 600 grams of dog droppings a day is enough to provide an average fox with enough energy. The results suggest that many cases of interspecies coprophagia go unnoticed. It is possible that this phenomenon is much more common in nature than is commonly thought. However, it should be noted that, unlike foxes, other Scottish predators did not eat dog bait. Thus, coprophagia is perhaps most likely between species with near tropical niches. Their plastic behavior and environmental flexibility allow them to learn very unusual food sources. For example, in London, they eat dead cats. And in Washington Zoo, a wild fox went into a waterfowl's lair and killed 25 red flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) and one duck. Sergei Kelenov"

This maneuver will allow the spacecraft to reach a distant retrograde lunar orbit, where it will spend a week testing its systems, NASA reports. Orion went into space on November 16, 2022, when the SLS carrier rocket took it to the moon. The entire Orion flight will take 25.5 days, and 10 Cubs have been launched into space, four of which will explore the moon. During the flight to the Moon, Orion tested its systems, and made three trajectory corrections before entering the Moon Hill sphere, after which another engine was turned on. On the afternoon of November 21, 2022, Orion made a close orbit of the Moon, at a minimum distance of 130 kilometers from the surface of Earth's natural satellite, and then entered the Moon's shadow, losing contact with Earth for half an hour. Then the connection was restored. During the flight, cameras installed on the outer parts of the ship captured a number of images of the Earth and the Moon. This is the first of two maneuvers the ship needs to go into a long retrograde orbit around the moon, which is scheduled for November 25. The spacecraft will remain in orbit for a week, then make a second close-up moon landing and return to Earth. You can read about the Artemis program and the first flight in the Artemis Mission."

    "translated_title": "In the Sanxinguya sacrificial pit , a bronze statue of a half-man half-snake was discovered .",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have reported new finds made during the excavation of the Sanxingui monument. In the sacrificial pits, they found a large number of artifacts, including bronze masks, phoenixes, and a box with pencils in the shape of a dragon's head. Among the finds is a snake body and a human head, which appears to have incorporated elements from three ancient cultures. This was reported by the Chinese Xinhua news agency. In the Bronze Age (about 45002800 years ago) there was a cansingdu culture in modern China, named after the town of the same name  fortified settlement surrounded by walls, mounds and ditches. This monument was discovered by accident in the upper Yangtze River (Sichuan Province) during field work in 1931, when a pit containing jade products was found. An important event in the history of this town was the discovery in 1986 of two sacrificial pits, inside which archaeologists discovered about 1720 objects, including statues, heads and masks. Over the years, archaeologists have unearthed more than 50 sites inside the settlement, including homes and public buildings. It is assumed that Sanxingui in the 2nd millennium BC was the center of the ancient Shu state, which is known from the \"Historical Notes\" of Siam Cyan. However, the main finds in Sanskrit come from sacrificial pits, which contained a large number of bronze and other metal objects, as well as burned bones. The items were placed in these pits in a special order. The bottom layer was made of jade, then bronze and gold artifacts, the third layer was made of animal bones, and at the top were ceramics and bronze slats. In total, scientists have discovered more than 50,000 artifacts on the monument, including a large statue of a standing man, a bronze \"sacred tree\", statues of kneeling people, anthropomorphic heads and a column with a dragon carved into it. Archaeologists from the Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology of Sichuan Province, Beijing and Sichuan Universities reported on new finds made during excavations in Sansingdu. Since 2020, they have discovered six new sacrificial pits on this monument, but the main finds have been made in only two of them (pits-7 and pits-8). During excavations of the sacrificial pit 7, archaeologists discovered a bronze box with curved walls, horns and pencils in the shape of a dragon's head. Inside this artifact was a piece of dark green jade. In the same pit, archaeologists unearthed jade disks, bronze phoenix and bell towers, as well as the tools of the axe and the toothpick. The sacrifice pit-8 was rich in bronze masks  about 70 finds. In addition, scientists have unearthed sculptures that combine human and animal features, including a 1.6-meter bronze half-man-half-snake figure. Also in Sanskrit, bronze dragon sculptures were found, which are typical of many other Chinese monuments and seem to indicate early exchanges within this civilization. The researchers focused on the half-man-half-snake figure. For example, Zhang Hao of Peking University noted that the sculpture is divided into three parts. Its central part is a serpent, depicted by an ancient master with the head of a man with puffy eyes and large claws. A vessel with the inscription \"zhuong\"  is located on the head, a symbol of the culture of the people living in the area of the Huanghe River. In addition, a human-headed snake is on a bowl standing on a square bottom, the symbol of the Zhou tribe before its conquest of the Shang dynasty in the 12th-17th centuries BC. The relic was apparently a combination of elements from three cultures, proving that the Sunshine was an important part of ancient Chinese civilization. Previously on N+1, we've been talking about jobs in Sanskrit. Last year, Chinese archaeologists reported excavations of sacrificial pits, where they found artifacts made of ivory, gold, jade, and bronze, including a statue over a meter high and a giant ritual mask.

    "translated_title": "HP has introduced a robo-printer to print the construction plan on the floor of the future house",
    "translated_text": "HP has introduced a robot that travels the floors of buildings and signs construction plans. This allows builders to spend less time and improve the accuracy of building walls and other elements. The most obvious direction in building robotics is to create robots that directly build buildings or parts of them. And there's progress in that direction, like we talked about a robot for assembling reinforcing structures and a self-contained trench excavator. But while robots like these, which replace humans directly in construction, rarely go beyond the lab. There's another approach: creating robot assistants that work in tandem with builders and facilitate or speed up the work. Often, these robots work with a building plan. So there are robots that go around the construction site and check if the structures are consistent with the drawings from the database. HP introduced the SitePrint robot, which also works with drawings, but in a different way. It's basically a printer on wheels, but it's adapted for construction. It has three wheels: two large leads and one small passive one at the rear. Before the floor is marked, the robot receives a drawing (a plan of the walls and other elements) and communicates with the robotic tachometer. It's now compatible with Leica and Topcon tachometers, and HP plans to expand the list of supported devices in the future. After the site starts working, SitePrint travels the floor and signs the lines and signatures. It can travel on both smooth surfaces and rough surfaces, such as asphalt. During the ride, it automatically surrounds obstacles using visual sensors (the company does not reveal which ones). The robot uses two batteries, each of which provides four hours of operation. HP is currently testing the robot with several companies in closed mode. The production version is expected to be released next year. Last year, we talked about a Sony robot that the company is testing in construction. It is characterized by an unusual design with up and down wheels that allow it to climb obstacles while remaining in a nearly horizontal position. Grigory Kopiyev"

    "translated_title": "Parrot Quadcopter got a wire to work without landing at 100 meters",
    "translated_text": "The French company Arastelle has developed a power system that allows the Parrot Anafi USA drone to receive power from the wire and operate for almost unlimited hours. One of the main drawbacks of electric multi-copters  is the short flight time on one charge, usually 30-50 minutes. This makes them less convenient to use for certain tasks, like watching people at large events. There are actually two ways to extend flight time. The drone can be equipped with an internal combustion engine and a fuel canister, so the flight time can increase to 10 hours. The multi-copter can also be powered by wire, so its flight time is almost unlimited. In addition, this system can be used to power the drone with liquid. For example, this way you can wash high-rise structures. Typically, wired power systems are created for homemade or small-scale drones, most often larger ones, rather than standard-sized serial quadcopters. Arastelle introduced a system that allows the Parrot Anafi USA to be wired, without having to modify the drone itself. From the photos, the company has developed a module for this, which is almost identical in size and shape to a battery module and can be installed in its slot, but the bottom of it is a wire to connect to a power station on the ground. Arastelle notes that the system can be adapted to other drones  probably by creating a similar module for them in the battery compartment. The system allows you to lift the drone to a height of up to 100 meters and, for example, watch large crowds of people at mass events. The company also showed an example of the integration of the system into a moving machine. Wired feeding allows the drone to fly without landing almost any time (at least while all its components are correct), but the altitude of such a flight is limited. Recently, engineers have reviewed the parameters of such systems and imposed theoretical limits on the altitude of drones on the ground. Grigory Kopiyev"

    "translated_title": "ALMA saw a short gamma-ray burst in the millimeter range for the first time.",
    "translated_text": "Astronomers using the ALMA radio telescope system first observed the afterglow of a short gamma-ray burst in the millimeter wave range. Such observations allow for more accurate detection of the outburst parameters and are less susceptible to the interstellar environment and radiation of the host galaxy. The print of the work is published on the arXiv website. The first is the Internet. Short gamma bursts are powerful gamma-ray bursts lasting less than two seconds. They are formed by the merging of compact objects, both or one of which is a neutron star. Such phenomena, accompanied by post-glare, are important to astrophysicists as the only observed source of elements synthesized during the r-process and as a process associated with gravitational wave bursts. Observations of gamma-ray bursts after lightning allow us to accurately locate its host galaxy, as well as to learn the parameters of the environment where the burst source is located, and to test its generation models. A team of astronomers led by Tanmoy Laskar of the University of Neumann reported the first recorded short gamma-ray burst in the millimeter wavelength range ever made by the ALMA radio telescope system. Observations of the millimeter-range afterglow are important to astrophysicists because they are not affected by the interstellar environment, the heat radiation of the kilon and host galaxy, and the Compton reverse effect, and they allow for a more accurate estimation of the burst parameters. The target of the observations was the source of the GRB 211106A gamma-ray burst, which was originally recorded by the INTEGRAL space telescope early in the morning of November 6, 2021. It was later followed by the Fermi, Swift, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Hubble and the ATCA (Australia Telescope Compact Array) ground-based radio telescope. ALMA observed GRB 211106A at 97.5 GHz 12.9 days after the surge was recorded. The galaxy-host of the burst source is characterized by a red shift of z in the range of 0.71,4. The burst was one of the brightest afterglow, which was not observed in the optical range, due to the strong shading of the source by dust. The afterglow itself is created by the interaction of the environment surrounding the source of the flash with the collimated jet that is created by the fusion of compact objects. In the case of GRB 211106A, the jet's angle of expansion to the earth observer was about 16 degrees, and the jet's total kinetic energy was 2×1050  6×1051 erg, which is one of the largest values for short gamma-ray bursts. Scientists believe that further search for short gamma-ray bursts with ALMA should allow detecting similar phenomena in the millimeter wave range within two days of the burst at a rate of 0.81.6 events per year, which is more than searching for bursts in the centimeter wave range. We've talked about how a long gamma-ray burst was linked to an abnormally powerful giant out-of-galactic magnetic burst and how an exoplanet-hunting telescope first saw the optical afterglow of a gamma-ray burst.

    "translated_title": "Chinese showcase city autopilot for production car",
    "translated_text": "Chinese company XPeng showed off the tests of an advanced driver assistance system on the streets of Guangzhou. The car drove 26 kilometers fully autonomously, although an engineer was driving. The autopilot was tested on the XPeng P5 series electric car, but so far it's a beta version, not available to regular drivers. Today, there are driverless cars that drive around cities, carry passengers, and even charge money. But to say that driverless cars are now available to ordinary people is very conditional: there are only a few small driverless taxi services in the world, and it's impossible to buy a car like this for personal use. This is due to legal difficulties, including the prohibitions by lawmakers and the responsibility of the developers of unmanned vehicles, as well as the technical and financial issues, in particular, sensors and other equipment for unmanned driving, which typically cost more than the car itself. However, publicly available production cars already have advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that do not make the car completely unmanned but bring it closer to it. Tesla has the most functional system of its kind at the moment: in 2020, the company allowed some ordinary drivers to use a beta version of the city autopilot, which is technically capable of driving a city route without the driver's involvement, stopping at headlights, rearranging from row to row and performing all other aspects of road traffic. The driver is still responsible for the road and the driver is responsible for any accidents. In early July, Chinese electric car maker XPeng showed beta testing of a similar driver assistance system to City NGP, capable of autonomous driving in urban conditions. The raid took place during daylight hours in Guangzhou. During the ride, an engineer was in the car, holding his hands on or near the wheel, but not interfering with the car's handling, but only monitoring the correctness of the autopilot. During the test, the car drove 34 traffic lights, turned 14 times at intersections, drove through small roadblocks and encountered other typical urban situations. Noteworthy is that XPeng's autopilot not only shows a map of the surrounding space with other cars and its trajectory, but also, unlike Tesla, accompanies some of its maneuvers with voice explanations that allow the driver to understand the logic of the car's actions or warn him of certain events. In addition, the P5, unlike Tesla cars, uses two front-facing cameras that give more accurate information about the distance to objects and their shape. It's worth noting that this is an internal beta version of the software, not available to P5 owners. The company plans to release it after further testing and approval from the Chinese authorities. In 2019, researchers from the American Automotive Association found that as drivers get used to ADAS, they become more and more distracted by outside tasks, even though the system requires them to keep track of the road.

Scientists have yet to determine the source of the shock and its nature, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure) was the first fully operational seismograph to explore another planet. It was brought to Mars by the InSight station, which landed it next to it in the Utopia Plain in late 2018. The first seismic quake was recorded in the spring of 2019, and the number of recorded seismic events has now exceeded a thousand. By analyzing the data collected, planetary scientists examine models of Mars' internal structure and look for the reasons for its current tectonic activity. Until recently, the maximum magnitude of the SEIS Marsquake detected was 4.2, a similar event occurred on August 25, 2021. However, on May 4, 2022, this record was broken  a seismograph detected a seismic event with a magnitude of 5, which is close to the calculation upper limit predicted for the InSight scientific program. On Earth, such tremors are considered to be a medium-force earthquake that does not cause severe destruction. Scientists working with SEIS need to complete the analysis of the available data before they can determine the source of the shock and its nature. We've talked about how, with SEIS, scientists linked Marsquakes to magma activity in the top mantle and first recorded Marsquakes on the other side of the planet. InSight's exploration of the planet can be seen in the materials \"Looking Inside the Red Planet\", \"A Seismograph for Mars\", and \"45 centimeters in 50 years\". Alexander Voytyk"

    "translated_title": "The Chinese have developed a 35-gram drone with propellers on the propeller",
    "translated_text": "Hong Kong engineers have created a 35-gram bicopter, which is a wing with two parallel earth screws. They allow the wing to be rolled up to create lifting force. Despite this design, the drone can fly, controlling movement on all axes. The article was published in Science Robotics. Over the past few years, multi-copter has become almost synonymous with the term drone because this design is used much more often than others. The multi-copter is a simple and inexpensive circuit, and it's easy to operate. But these devices are less efficient than helicopters with a large screw that can also hang in one place, and planes that can't hang, but have a large wing that creates lifting power and allows you to travel long distances much more efficiently. And while most designers use these three schemes or a combination of them, like convertible planes, some experiment with alternative schemes that aren't as well studied and tested in practice. For example, we talked about a Singapore drone project with a propeller on a propeller. A team of engineers led by Pakpong Chirarattananon of the City University of Hong Kong developed a similarly designed but much smaller  35.1 grams. The drone has a symmetrical design. The control panel and battery are located in the center, and a polyamide film wing is attached to thin and light carbon plastic racks on both sides. Nearer to the edge of each wing console is one electric motor with a propeller, with the consoles and propellers themselves located in opposite directions. The drone moves propellers to take off, and although the rotors themselves are parallel to the ground, they move the wing, which forms lifting force and lifts the drone into the air. Engineers have developed a simple control algorithm that has two parts: one is responsible for vertical position and the other for directional motion. To control height, it is enough to change the traction equally on both propellers, and for horizontal motion the algorithm changes the ratio between their traction during each wing turn. Test flights have shown that a drone with a 250-millimeter-hour battery and a total mass of 35.1 grams can last 14.9 minutes in the air, and if the battery is replaced by a larger battery (650 millimeter-hours), the flight time increases to 24.5 minutes. But then the total weight increases to 42.8 grams. The authors demonstrated the drone's controlled flight, and also showed that it was capable of carrying a small payload. So they've attached a camera to the drone to take panoramic video and a laser rangefinder, which by rotation actually turns into a 2D leader, suitable for detecting obstacles around the camera. Engineers note that the shape of the drone was inspired by the wing of some trees, which is made in the shape of a wing.

    "translated_title": "Archaeologists in Norway have found an ancient leather shoe",
    "translated_text": "Norwegian archaeologists have reported the results of their study of the Hestfonnis ice spot. Within a few years, they had discovered ancient stone indicators, iron cords, one of which was about 700 years old, and artifacts associated with the hunt for the northern deer. Among the finds are the remains of leather shoes dating from about 300 C.E. The Secrets of the Ice project team reports this on their Facebook page*. Climate change has led to the development of glacial archaeology, in which scientists search for and explore artifacts and remains that have long been preserved in ice. The ice mummy that was found in 1991 and that had been lying in the Aztec Alps for more than five millennia was a catalyst for the development of this field, as detailed in our article \"From the Abyss to the Ice\". Research in glacial archaeology is being conducted in different regions of the planet. In Canada, mummies of a werewolf and a caribou were found, in Mongolia, the remains of archangels and ancient weapons were discovered. For such studies, the Scandinavian Mountains, home to the largest glaciers in continental Europe, were a promising region. Systematic work on the site began in 2011, when archaeologists found a frozen wool tunic from the 3rd to 4th centuries of our era near the Lendbrane Mountains. Since then, archaeologists, including the Secrets of the Ice team, have made hundreds of finds, the oldest of which are about 6,000 years old. Only in the last few years have they found an ancient busy road, a lost Viking settlement, a medieval candle box, wooden skis, and hundreds of \"pook sticks\". Archaeologists from the Secrets of the Ice project have reported the results of a study of the mountain falls where the ice stain of Hestfonny is located. The name of this site, located near Landbrane, suggests that the site was once associated with horses, although it is located at a high altitude. In particular, this passage was used by local cattle ranchers during seasonal movements. The first few expeditions to the area brought only poorly preserved artifacts related to the northern deer hunt. In addition, scientists have discovered several stone indicators. Among the first discoveries made six years ago that would have indicated human movements through the area were a horse bone and an iron fist. The shape of this artifact suggests it was made in the post-medieval period. Two years later, the collection was filled with more ancient artifacts. So, on the surface of the ice, archaeologists have discovered a hilltop that dates back to about 1300 AD. At the end of the 2019 field season, archaeologists received reports from tourists that the Frosty Frosty of Hestfonny had melted heavily. The researchers were given photos of the finds and their GPS coordinates. When they arrived at the site, they discovered a leather artifact that turned out to be a shoe, presumably from the Iron Age. Recent radio-carbon analysis has confirmed the guess of archaeologists  the find dates to about 300 AD. Other discoveries at the site included horsehair and textile fragments. Using the radiocarbon method, scientists have determined that they date back to the Viking Age and centuries earlier. Archaeologists have stressed that the ice sheet of Hestfonne has not yet melted as much as it did with Landbrane, so there are likely to be many discoveries there in the coming years. By studying stone indicators in the area of Hestfonny, archaeologists have discovered three ancient trails that people used to walk along. While studying one of them, scientists came across the remains of an old stone shelter that was probably used to protect against the elements. They also found artifacts related to deer hunting: a fragment of the bow, \"swings\", as well as two arrows and one tip. The last one was pretty unusual. It was made of horn and decorated with two carved zigzags about 2000-3000 years ago. Recently, N+1 was talking about other archaeological finds made by researchers from the Secrets of the Ice project. At the Sandgrovskardet Pass, they found ancient arrows and \"sticks\" and found stone hunting shelters. *Facebook is owned by Meta, which is banned in Russia"

    "translated_title": "Chemists have an inorganic analogue of ferrocene",
    "translated_text": "Chemists from Germany and China have developed a sandwich compound that has iron between two four-membered rings of phosphorus atoms. The completely inorganic analogue of ferrocene was synthesized in two stages from red phosphorus and iron salt. The product was a stable crystalline substance. The article was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ferrocene is a sandwich compound of iron with the formula [Fe(C5H5)2] in which the metal atom is between two five-membered cycles of carbon atoms. It was first awarded in 1951 by Thomas Kiley (Thomas J. Kealy) and Peter Poson (Peter L. Pauson), which laid the foundation for the chemistry of metallic elements. Later, scientists learned to replace carbon rings of metallic rings with inorganic s of phosphorus or arsenic atoms. For example, by reacting NaP5 salt with iron dichloride in the presence of sodium cyclopentadiene, you can obtain a ferrocene analogue [Fe(C5H5) ((P5)], in which one of the five-membered rings will be carbonic, and the other  phosphorus. But to get a compound where both five-membered rings would only consist of phosphorus atoms, until we could. But according to computer calculations, the molecule [Fe(P5)2] is not inferior to ferrocene in stability. Chemists led by Sun Zhong-Ming of Nankai University decided to get another inorganic analogue of ferrocene with four-membered phosphorus cycles. They assumed that such a compound would be stable as a double-charged anion. A good source of its synthesis is the combination with the formula KP , a product of the interaction of metallic potassium with red phosphorus. First, the scientists mixed potassium with phosphorus in a one-to-one ratio, wiped the mixture into powder and heated it to 500 degrees for 24 hours. The resulting chemical was dissolved in ethylene diamine, and iron tret-butylate (III) Fe(Ot-Bu)3 and cryptandane were added to the solution to bind potassium ions. Two hours later, the chemists separated the sediment and left the solution for two weeks. The result is the red crystals of two substances that are stable in the air. Recrystallization of pyridine allowed them to be separated, and chemists began to figure out the structure of the products. X-ray structural analysis of the crystals obtained showed that the byproduct of the reaction is potassium salt with an anion [Fe(P4)2]2-, in which two four-membered rings of phosphorus atoms surround the iron atom. It's a compound they wanted to get chemicals. But the main product was salt with an anion of a more complex structure. It had a four-membered phosphorus ring on one side of the iron atom, and a bicyclic fragment of seven phosphorus atoms on the other. The structure of both compounds was further confirmed by mass spectrometry and YMR spectroscopy on phosphorus-31 nuclei. Then the chemists tried to increase the output of a ferrocene analog. They found that one of the side effects was oxidation of P42 groups by three-wavelength iron. To prevent this, scientists added a quarter of the metallic potassium equivalent to the reaction mixture. They were able to get a mixture of salts in a five to one ratio. The main product was an anion salt [Fe(P4)2]2-. As a result, chemists have obtained a completely inorganic analogue of ferrocene. It was a potassium salt, the anion of which [Fe(P4)2]2- had a sandwich structure. The output was 63 percent. The authors believe that their synthesis method will allow for other phosphorus analogues of sandwich compounds. Sandwich complexes are not just made of metal. We recently talked about how chemists got the first sandwich complexes of the nonmetal selenium and the semimetal telur. Michael Boim"

    "translated_title": "Quantum wandering atoms helped search with the oracle.",
    "translated_text": "American physicists experimentally implemented quantum wandering of neutral strontium-88 atoms in cells of a two-dimensional optical lattice. The distribution and expansion of the atomic wave function in their work was in good agreement with a simple model up to a hundred-node field. Scientists have also demonstrated how wandering can be used to implement a quantum search algorithm with an oracle. The study was published in Science. Random wandering is a mathematical model of a process in which a point in some space makes a sequence of random steps. Space can have any nature, and the model itself is as versatile as possible, which is why it finds application in many different fields. With it, scientists describe Browne's movement of molecules, animal movement, the emergence of new scientific ideas, the odds of winning sports competitions, and even the shift in light and dark stripes in a person's life. The power of this method was recognized by the award of the Abel Prize in 2020. Like many other classic models and games, random wandering has been subjected to quantum generalization. Quantum wandering is distinguished by the ability of a particle to be in a superposition of states corresponding to steps in different directions. This leads to unusual effects, like quantum interference and reversible unitary evolution. The accident involves stochastic effects that lead to loss of coherence and even a collapse of wave function. These properties make the model suitable for quantum computation and quantum simulation. Quantum wandering is most closely related to the movement of cold electrons in a crystal lattice described by Hubbard's model. In order for the simulation of their dynamics by means of wandering to be of tangible benefit, the number of lattice nodes must be large. Scaling up the various physical platforms (photons, nuclear spines, ions, and more) that are suitable for this, one way or another, faces the problem of noise that disrupts coherence. A group of American physicists led by Adam Kaufman of the University of Colorado at Boulder chose neutral atoms to work with, wandering between the nodes of a two-dimensional optical lattice with several thousand nodes. Not only did they show that the quantum wandering of atoms within a hundred nodes is very well aligned with Hubbard's model, but they used them to implement the quantum algorithm of oracle search. At the beginning of each experimental cycle, the authors captured single strontium-88 atoms in an optical pincet and placed them in the middle of a two-dimensional optical lattice formed by the intersection of a single layer of a one-dimensional optical lattice with a square array of elongated optical traps. The laser parameters were selected to provide an average of one step of wandering per millisecond. The scientists' design supports time travel. Physicists studied their dynamics by repeating the experiment for the right moments of time and measuring the position of the atom as it scatters light. Measurement destroys the superposition, but repeating the cycle several hundred to several thousand times allowed physicists to obtain the spatial density of probability and compare it to modeling. The degree of the theory's and the experiment's data's compatibility was very high, up to five milliseconds. The most likely locations of atoms were at the corners and sides of a square expanding at some speed, with a pattern of interference bands in the middle. In the old days, the heterogeneity of the grid was blurring the picture. In the next stage, the authors used wandering to search with the oracle. Calculations are called calculations where there is a mechanism in the system that knows the right answer. In this work, the oracle was further outraged by the pincet. The formal task of the scientists was to determine the point of the outburst through quantum wandering, without knowing where the oracle was going. The starting point for the algorithm was the state of the uniform superposition of several neighboring nodes, and the correct answer was the state of the atom in the node on which the oracle was acting. To force the grid + oracle system to indicate the answer, physicists adjusted the amplitude of the latter so that the underlying state was a superposition of the initial and the desired states. The probability of encountering a particle at a particular point in the lattice will oscillate according to the laws of quantum dynamics, but for the desired node it will significantly stand out against the background of the rest halfway through the period. Physicists have experimentally demonstrated how this algorithm works for wandering within 13 nodes of the lattice. Further increasing distances led to a decrease in the amplitude of the oscillations. If within 45 nodes the signal was still out, although it was less than the response amplitude at the beginning of the coordinates, then it was finally extinguished. However, the authors note that the latter provides a resource for increasing the algorithm's scope of work by further technical improvements to the trap. In addition, the algorithm itself could be improved by simultaneously wandering several particles and incorporating spine degrees of freedom. Discrete wandering suggests that the number of walkers remains constant. The situation where the number of them can increase and decrease is one of the variations of the game Life. We also talked about its quantum counterpart. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_text": "Planetologists have created a new detailed three-dimensional model of the interior structure of Mars' northern polar cap based on radar data collected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) probe over 13 years of observations. The article was published in The Planetary Science Journal. The northern polar cap of Mars is composed of two main components: basal formations from a mixture of water ice, dust and sand, and thin layers of sediment, which are 95 percent water ice. The surface layer of the hat also contains frozen carbon dioxide. The study of the cap using orbital apparatus is important for scientists in terms of understanding its structure, as all the structures observed on the surface and inside the polar cap are thought to reflect the course of climate cycles on Mars in the past. A group of planetologists led by Nathaniel Putzig of the US Planetary Institute has presented a new detailed three-dimensional model of the internal structure of Mars' northern polar cap based on radar observations of the SHARAD instrument (Mars SHAllow RADar sounder), installed on board the MRO. The model was built on the basis of 3399 two-dimensional radarograms obtained from December 2006 to September 2019. SHARAD can detect elements up to 15 meters in size and penetrate to a depth of up to 4 kilometers. The final model consists of three cuts of the 1200 kilometre wide North Plateau, horizontal and two vertical. They show the structure of the upper layer, two kilometers thick. A 300-kilometer-diameter black circle shows an area that is not accessible to a radar tool. Inside the plateau, there are regions with alternating water ice and eol sand layers stretching in a transverse direction for tens and hundreds of kilometers, as well as a canyon buried under the sediments. In addition, it was observed that the spiral falls observed in the cap moved over time, suggesting that this was due to the processes of ablation and freezing of ice by the winds. Scientists believe that a detailed study of the model will take several years and would allow for serious restrictions on the geological and climatic history of the Northern Plateau. Earlier, we talked about how the nature of Mars' ice lakes, discovered by radar, was explained by volcanic sediment and liquid salt."

    "translated_title": "Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded for click-chemistry",
    "translated_text": "The winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry are Caroline Bertotzzi (Carolyn R. The first is the \"Bertotzzi\", the \"Morten Meldahl\" (Morten P. Meldal) and Barry Sharpless (K. Barry Sharpless) for his development of click-chemistry and biorotonal chemistry. Barry Sharpless received his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001 and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his stereo selective oxidation reactions. The award ceremony can be seen live on the Nobel Committee website. The press release details the winners' research. The winners will receive their prizes at an official ceremony on December 10. Barry Sharpless, now a two-time Nobel laureate, has spent his entire life working in organic chemistry. He wanted to invent chemical reactions that could run in water, in the presence of oxygen, quickly and at high output. In his 2004 article, he cited several well-known such reactions and grouped them together into a class of click-reactions. But you could say that the click chemistry itself started when Morten Meldal published an article in 2002 about the catalytic acid-alkin cycloattachment. That same year, Barrie Sharpless and his colleagues reported this reaction, independently of Meldal. The acid-alkin cycloattachment reaction takes place between molecules of two substances that contain two different functional groups  acid and alkin. The acid group consists of three interconnected nitrogen atoms. Alkines are called substances with a triple carbon bond. Two molecules in the presence of a copper-based catalyst are joined into one and give the triazol a cyclic heterocycle with three nitrogen atoms. And the reaction is usually quick and high-output. Two years later, Caroline Bertozzi joined the research on click chemistry and found a specific application. She was able to conduct an acid-alkin cycloattack reaction without a catalyst: for this she originally took a sterile-stressed alkin cycloactin, which easily transitioned into a product, thanks to the thermodynamic advantage of reducing the voltage from the cyclic core. This reaction was bioorthogonal. It didn't interfere with biological processes in living cells. And so Bertozzi successfully applied it to study the glycans of the polysaccharides found on the surface of cells. They are involved in cellular recognition processes and play an important role in immune processes. There was no Nobel laureate on the list of Clarivate analysts for 2022. According to the company's citation, Zhenan Bao from Stanford University, who specializes in organic polymers, was selected by Daniel Nocher (Daniel G. Nocera), which is involved in reactions with the simultaneous transport of protons and electrons, as well as Bonnie Bassler (Bonnie L. Bassler) from Princeton University and Peter Greenberg (E. Peter Greenberg of the University of Washington. They figured out how bacteria cells regulate gene expression depending on population density. In 2013, Clarivate's predecessor, Thompson Reuters, included Barry Sharpless and another click chemistry researcher, Valerie Fokin, in the list of potential winners. In 2021, the award was given to Benjamin Least and David Macmillan for their development of asymmetric organocatalysis to obtain enantiomerically pure organic matter. You can read more about the winners and their research in our article \"Mirror Chemistry\". In 2020, the award was given to biochemists Jennifer Dudne and Emmanuel Sharpantier. They developed CRISPR/Cas9  technology that allows you to edit DNA accurately. We discussed this technology, its potential, and its applications in the text \"Everyone Should Know These Letters\".

    "translated_title": "The repeated freezing has not prevented Etzi from surviving to this day",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have reviewed the conditions under which Etzi's body was located after his death. It appears to have originally been located above the crack where it was found in 1991. Moreover, for about a thousand and a half years, Etzi repeatedly freed himself partially or completely from the ice. Most scientists previously assumed that the mummy's excellent preservation was due to its constant presence under the alpine ice and snow for more than 5,000 years. This is reported in an article published in the journal The Holocene. In 1991, German tourists made one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. In the Aztec Alps, at 3,210 meters above sea level, they discovered a mummified human body frozen in ice. His name was Etzi from where he was found. The well-preserved ice mummy belonged to an adult man who lived about 33603100 years before our era. His clothes and shoes have survived, along with copper axe, onion, arrow-shaped hooks, a ruthless shoe, and some other items. Initially, scientists assumed that Etzi died on a mountain pass as a result of an accident, such as falling into a crack or freezing at high altitude. But in 2001, on an X-ray, researchers noticed the tip of the arrow entering the body from behind. It was later discovered that the arrow had broken through the connective artery, leading to rapid blood loss and death. Lars Pilø of the Department of Cultural Heritage of the Inlandet district, together with colleagues from Austria, Norway and Switzerland, decided to test the hypothesis regarding the preservation of the Etzi mummy. After its discovery, the researchers concluded that the \"Ice Man\" and his belongings were preserved by being permanently under the ice. Originally, archaeologists assumed that Etzi died in a narrow chasm free of ice and snow. Soon the glacier covered the site, and the body and artifacts remained frozen for more than five thousand years, with a narrow fissure protecting them from the destructive force of the moving glacier. It was believed that Etzi died in late summer or autumn  the thorn fruit (Prunus spinosa) found near the mummy indicated this. However, in 1998 a pollen of the common carpinifolia (Ostrya carpinifolia) was found in the intestines of the Etzi, which indicated that it died in the spring. The leaves found in the bark bag were also indicated for late spring or early summer. Furthermore, the location of the finds indicated that they reached our day in displaced condition. According to the authors of the new paper, the evidence that has been gathered suggests that Etzi died outside the narrow chasm where his body was found. Scientists believe that in the spring or early summer, Etzi's dead body lay on/in the snow above a crack, where it and the artifacts (or parts of them) later fell, apparently along with meltwater. It may not even have happened the same year. After that, the mummy and the objects were exposed several times to water as a result of melting ice and snow. Apparently, as a result of these movements, many items were broken. Scientists noted that the volume of alpine glaciers reached a minimum during the time of the holographic optimum (about ninefive thousand years ago), and a maximum  during the time of the little ice age (about 12501870 CE). The glaciers expanded significantly much later than the death of Etzi some 3,000 to 2,600 years ago. According to the researchers, for about a thousand and a half years his body and artifacts were repeatedly released from the ice. It was previously thought that this would not allow organic materials to survive as well as we do today. But the accumulated experience in glacial archaeology has shown that the cold environment of the high mountains prevented rapid decay. However, it is difficult to determine how many times Etzi's body (or body parts) were exposed and how long they lasted. For more information on what scientists have discovered about Etzi in three decades of research, see our article \"From the Ice Hole\"."

    "translated_title": "High-ranking naked land miners found an enlarged spleen .",
    "translated_text": "German scientists have observed that the size of the sleaze in naked miners from one colony can vary greatly. In search of the reason for this difference, the researchers found that the landmine squirrel has unique features that are not found in other rodents. It appears that its functions have changed in response to a persistent lack of oxygen, but to protect against infections, it's probably gotten worse. But it turns out that individuals with large spleen tend to have a high status in the colony. Perhaps the size of the spleen enhances their immune system a little and allows them to live longer. The work was published in the journal Open Biology. Naked earth mines are not only remarkable for living ten times longer than most rodents. Because of their longevity and unusual habitat (underground tunnels in Africa), they have accumulated a number of features in the work of various organs. They have their own mechanisms to protect cells from turning into tumors, but they have weaker receptors in the inner ear and braking mechanisms in the nervous system. Naked land miners are also known to have rare age-related diseases that are typical of humans and other mammals. So we can assume that their immune systems have acquired some important differences. In addition, some features have already been found in other long-lived, blind rodents: they have a very short immune memory, and as a result, they retain more of the naive lymphocytes that are ready to develop an immune response to a new infection. A group of German scientists from the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine led by Gary Lewin (Gary R. Lewin) decided to find out what's going on with the immunity of naked miners. The researchers noted that the miners living in their lab died mostly from wounds received in clashes with relatives. Scientists also noted that animals often had to fall asleep because the wounds did not heal and the miners could not cope with the infection they had. Besides, it's been known for a long time that naked earth mines can't handle some of the most pathogenic viruses, like herpes. So the authors decided to study the saliva of naked land miners. It's an important part of the immune response in adult mammals. It's usually where the cells of acquired immunity, lymphocytes, rest in anticipation of their encounter with the antigen. It can also produce some blood cells, thus supporting the red bone marrow in stressful situations. First, researchers measured the size of the spleen in the land miners and found that it fluctuated strongly. They identified two groups of animals, with small and large spleen: they had an average of 0.18 and 0.35 percent of their body weight respectively, meaning that the relative distribution was more than twice that. Usually, an enlarged spleen (at least in rodents) indicates some pathological process, most often inflammation. It turned out that this was also possible for miners: animals who suffered from wounds in combat had the largest spleen (up to 0.69 percent of body weight). However, many mines with large (0.35 percent) spleen had no wounds, and blood tests showed that they were healthy. Then the authors examined the seizures of the land miners on histological drugs. It turns out that in the mouse, there's less space for the white pulp, the area where the lymphocytes rest. Instead, the red pulp  zone is enlarged, which is responsible for blood production and removing old red blood cells from the bloodstream. The researchers suggested that the lack of a white pulp could explain the poor antiviral response of the miners. And they suggested that the expansion of the red pulp be considered a response to hypoxia. In other mammals, the spleen may be involved in the production of blood cells under extreme conditions, such as when the body lacks oxygen  and since the land mines are almost always underground, they may have this mechanism turned into a permanent one. However, the structure of the seashell in the miners did not depend on its size. Moreover, the proportion of the blood in the land miners with small and large spleen was the same. So the size distribution could not be explained by increased blood production. Then the researchers focused on the social status of naked miners. These animals are eusocial: their colony has a fairly strict distribution of roles and functions (breeding, food production, protecting the colony, etc.), and high status usually means longer life. It turns out that 75 percent of the miners with small slime had the lowest status in the colony. On the contrary, animals with enlarged spleen were often highly ranked. The authors concluded that the size of the spleen in the soil may not be a sign of health problems, but rather an indicator of the strength of the immune system and the number of immune cells. They also suggested that this would allow the colonies to preserve the highest status individuals, who on the one hand protect the tunnels from other animals (possible carriers of infection), and on the other hand, cannot isolate themselves from \"normal\" land miners if they get sick. Similar results were once seen in monkeys: the social status of the macaque was also linked to immunity. But in the case of the miners, we still have to figure out what mechanisms are providing this connection. And whether it's actually the increased immunity that helps high-ranking individuals live longer. We've written about how scientists were able to measure the biological age of naked miners. And how the miners from different colonies discovered their dialects. Polina Loseva"

    "translated_title": "A rare collection of Chinese bronze coins from the VIVII century has been found in Altai",
    "translated_text": "Siberian archaeologists have explored Chinese bronze coins found in Altai in an early medieval tomb. In total, they found 29 artifacts from the late VI  VII century CE, which were only present in women's and children's burials. It seems that the locals used the coins not as a means of payment, but to decorate the suit. This is reported in an article published in the journal Archaeology, Ethnography and Anthropology of Eurasia. During the time of the Turkish Kaganates, the Forest Altai was a periphery of nomadic empires, which is not documented in written sources. Moreover, this period is relatively poorly studied by archaeologists, so studying each major monument of the early Middle Ages can shed light on the previously unknown history of the population of this region. In the Krasnogorsky district of Altai Territory, on the right bank of the river Ish, the Mountain-10  cemetery is one of the basic monuments of the early Middle Ages in the south of Western Siberia, named after the nearby village. In 1997, 2000-2003, archaeologists excavated this burial complex, discovering 75 burials on an area of more than 2,200 square meters. The first excavations showed that the burial complex dates from about the VIVIII centuries AD, and was built on the site of an early iron age settlement. Most of the burials found were solitary. Three of the dead were buried with horses, which highlights their high social status. Some people's graves were empty of horse bones, but sometimes there was horse gear. Archaeologists have noted some of the traditions of the local population: the creation of secondary burials, the trepanation of skulls after death. An anthropological study of the remains showed that among the buried were people from two populations: Samoan and Turkic. Although many of the dead were buried with a variety of valuable burial goods, most of the finds have not yet been published. Nikolay Seregin of Altai State University, together with Siberian colleagues, studied Chinese bronze coins found during excavations at the Gornoye-10 cemetery. In total, the archaeologists found 29 coins that were present as an accompanying inventory in eight burials (6, 18, 4446, 48, 62 and 66). Scientists noted that the finds were only found in women's (n = 5) and children's (n = 3) graves (most of them had other valuable inventory), and most often they were originally located near the head of the deceased, on the chest or at the neck, and also in the area of the belt. Most of the coins were found along with the remains of a woman 3040 years old from a couple's burial. So, between her right elbow and her spine, there were seven artifacts, one more on her right shoulderbone. The excavated coins are represented by several different groups. Among them were the u-ju, the kai-yuan tun-bao, which are quite common outside China. In addition, there were quite rare Chan-pin u-ju and u-sin-da-bu coins. According to archaeologists, the collection of bronze Chinese coins found in the Minny-10 tomb is unusual for monuments in North and Central Asia. In the forested area of Altai, where this burial complex is located, such artifacts of the early Middle Ages were almost non-existent. The coins also allowed for the time of burial. Thus, the lower boundary cannot be earlier than 581 AD, and the upper boundary cannot be later than the 7th century (or the beginning of the 8th century). Researchers say similar dates are also demonstrated in a radiocarbon analysis, the results of which have not yet been published. The scientists also noted that in the early Middle Ages, Chinese coins were not used as a means of payment in North and Central Asia. Apparently, they were used as headgear or belt, pendant, and amulet. It is possible that the finds from the children's cemeteries also suggest that the remains of girls were found there. It is noteworthy that other items imported from China, such as metal mirrors or silk items, have not been found by archaeologists at the Minny-10 cemetery. Previously, N + 1 reported on the research of the Turkish burial grounds of the early Middle Ages. Thus, on the periphery of the early-Skif \"royal\" Turgun Tunnug-1, located in Tiva, the Turkish tombs of the VIIVIII centuries CE were excavated. And in a vase from a ruined Turkish burial, found by accident in Altai, they found the remains of a pork soup of a nomad's memorial food."

    "translated_title": "Age and laziness have increased the risk of developing cognitive dysfunction in dogs",
    "translated_text": "Scientists in the United States have found out what causes cognitive dysfunction in dogs. They included age, low physical activity, and eye and ear conditions in the history of the disease. It turns out that lazy dogs are at nearly 6.5 times the risk of moving dogs. The results of the study were published in Scientific Reports. Because Alzheimer's disease is difficult to study in humans, the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease are often studied in mice and rats. Often these are transgenic animals with mutations that lead to accelerated aging or memory decline. The problem is that these rodents cannot reproduce the full picture of Alzheimer's disease in humans, so the data they collect can be used with some limitations. And here, dogs can come to the rescue of researchers. In older dogs, there is neurodegenerative pathology  cognitive dysfunction in dogs. Her symptoms and histological features are very similar to those of people with Alzheimer's. It turns out that dogs with cognitive dysfunction can be a model organism for Alzheimer's. And this model will be closer to human, because disease develops naturally, without the help of genetic engineering. Sarah Yarborough and her colleagues from the University of Washington, together with the Dog Aging Project, collected and analyzed data on the behavior and health status of 15,109 domestic dogs. Each owner filled out a questionnaire to determine if the pet had a movement disorder, if it recognized humans, and so on. I 'm not . For every sign of dysfunction, the owner put out scores. If the dog scored 50 or more, the researchers thought it had cognitive dysfunction. The higher the score (maximum is eighty), the stronger the disease develops. Among the dogs in the study, 1.4 percent received 50 points, which means they were diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction. Dog owners also reported on the age, lifestyle and health of their pets: whether the dog was sterilized or not, how physically active, whether they had any illnesses during their lifetime. Scientists have tried to find a link between the data they've received. It turns out that every year after 10 years, you increase your chances of getting sick by 70 percent. And when they looked at not just age, but the whole set of factors -- gender, activity level, health status -- they found that the risk increased 52 percent every year. Low physical activity increased the risk of developing the disease by 6.47 times with other equals. Dogs with cognitive dysfunction also had more eye and ear diseases and neurological disorders in their history. The study authors note that the correlations found are fair for humans as well. For example, visual impairments are also more common in Alzheimer's patients than in healthy people, and physical activity helps improve cognitive function in neurodegenerative diseases. This further confirmed the scientists' assumption that dogs are fit for role as models for human neurodegenerative pathologies. The Dog Aging Project was launched in 2014 to learn more about dog aging and use this data in human aging studies. In 2019, the project was able to specify the formula for translating dog years into human years. The other one is Pauline Grebenkin."

    "translated_text": "I 've been researching The ruins of the Raban-Merkuli mountain fortress in Iraqi Kurdistan, archaeologists have come to I'm guessing that in the Parthenon era, there was an important fortification here. who controlled the area at the junction of the mountain and plain areas, and It's a cult center. Scientists have suggested that Rabbana-Merculis is the remains of an ancient The city of Natunia. The city whose location still remains It was located in the territory of the ancient kingdom of Adiben, which was part of the Parthenon from the end of the 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 3rd century It's our era. An article in the journal Antiquity reports on the study. The state of Adiaben with its capital in the city of Arbela (Arbela; modern Erbil) existed in Northern Mesopotamia at the end of the 1st millennium before the beginning of the first millennium. The earliest known of the The source of the king of Adiabena was Abdisar, who ruled in the first half of the second century BC. The coins with his image are preserved. Then Adiaben It was conquered by the Parthenon king Mithridates I, and since the reign of Mithridates II (12491 BC) was a permanent part of the Parthenon. Adiabene The mountains and the foothills of the north-central part of Zagros, and here scientists There are known remains of a few fortified settlements that existed in the Parfyan era, such as Amadia, excavated in 2017 in Kalatga-Darband or Kalech-i A Yadzigird already located in Western Iran. All these points have been controlled. roads that cross the Zagros Mountains and are important both from a trade and military point of view I'm not seeing. Two more . The fortresses of the Parfyan period Raban and Mercury were built so They are so close together that they are seen as a single system of fortifications. The twin town of Rabana-Merculy stands on the slopes of Mount Piramagrun in the territory modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan, 40 kilometres northwest of the city It's not a dream. Nearby is the valley of the Charmag River, which flows into the Lower Zab. (ancient Caprese). In 2009, during the first excavations of the townsite, Parfyan buildings were found, as well as various The objects that scientists used to determine that the fortress continued to exist and Later, in the Sasanian and Islamic times. Archaeologists from Germany and Iraq conducting joint work in Raban-Merculi under the leadership of Michael Brown of the University of Heidelberg, generalized results of studies conducted in the township in 20192021. Comparing with the data on finds in other fortified settlements of the same time and with Numismatic sources, scientists have tried to identify the fortress. Rabana-Merculi and define her role in this part of the Parthenon. The steep and rocky The slopes of the Pyramids themselves could have been a good defense. Walls and The towers were designed to enhance the defensive potential of this The natural citadel. Where the gap between Raban and Mercury is not The building was built by the builders and the construction of the walls. The result is a 4000-meter-long barrier connecting the two halves. The fortress. From the three tallest towers , her defenders were able to observe And I saw the Tassulj Pass on the other side of the valley, where there were several settlements. It's the opposite slope. In the Mercury, In addition to the main citadel with 14 buildings, archaeologists have found the remains of seven separately. standing rectangular structures of approximately 89 metres wide and 2022 long It's a meter. Each of these rooms consisted of five identical rooms. The researchers They assumed that these buildings were military barracks. The scientists in Rabana They found a ladder and a niche cut into the rock. Looks like a niche. was intended for the sacred fire of the impermanent attribute of the Zoroastrian The sanctuary. Since there is a small waterfall nearby, it could have been dedicated to Goddess of water and fertility, Anahites. A parisian pottery was found on the stairs . The era of the iron arrowheads. At the entrances to Rabana and Mercury are carved into the rocks by two reliefs, most likely depicting The founder of the fortified settlement. There's no writing on the relief. It's a way to identify his name. However , the statue of the ruler in this The same clothing found in the town of Hatra (about 230 kilometers to the west), The scientists have established that Rabbah-Merculus also depicts one of the kings of Adiben. The statue of Hatra dated to the first half of the second century AD, but in the accompanying inscription on The statue is mentioned by his ancestor, Natunissar, probably as the founder. The dynasty. The bronze coins found earlier, which bear the name The Natunissar fort, the researchers found, A ruler with this name lived in the early 1st century BC.

She was controlling the flow. part of the Zagros forests, which descended into the border with the Roman Empire, the Upper Mesopotamia, and at the same time, she was a guard at one of the trading The roads connecting the mountains to different parts of the Parthenon. Together with those who have directed and are responsible for this fortified point, Apparently, the power of the perfumed Adiabena. According to the authors of the study, That means they've continued to play a big role in the territorial The management. N + 1 already told me about archaeological The discovery of the history of the Parthenon. For example, scientists found the oldest images of hybrid camels in Hatra, and during the oil drilling, Well in Iran, a necropolis belonging to followers of Islam was discovered by accident.

    "translated_title": "The mysterious monkey from Borneo has been dubbed a carrier and a thin-bodied hybrid",
    "translated_text": "The mystery monkey that photographers and tourists have seen on Borneo since 2017 is an interbreed hybrid of carrier and grive-like subtle. Zoologists have come to this conclusion by analyzing all available photographs of this individual and reports of observations of it. As noted in an article for the International Journal of Primatology, the appearance of a hybrid  is an alarming sign. It suggests that the carriers and the thin bodies are forced to divide the few remaining fragments of the jungle, which increases the likelihood of their crossing. A few decades ago, zoologists believed that different primate species only interbreed in exceptional cases. However, modern molecular methods have allowed us to find out what happens regularly, primarily in the area of contact of the areals. And sometimes, although relatively rare, experts identify hybrids between primate species that inhabit the same area but occupy different ecological niches. Moreover, some species of monkeys are likely to have hybrid origins. In primates, interbreeding hybrids are mostly observed in captivity. Only three such individuals have been found in nature, all of them being hybrids of the gelada (Theropithecus gelada) and the avian anubis (Papio anubis). In addition, genetic data indicate that in the past, representatives of some other genera crossed each other. A team of zoologists led by Nadine Ruppert of the University of Science Malaysia has described another likely example of interracial hybridization in primates. They were focused on a mysterious ape from the Kinabatangan River in the Malay part of Borneo Island. When photos of this young individual, a member of the small-bodied grouper (Trachypithecus cristatus) (a monkey of the martin family that is common in Malaysia and Indonesia), first appeared on social media in 2017, experts pointed out that it cannot be attributed to any known species. It has been suggested that it is of a new species or that it is of hybrid origin. A new portion of the photos of an unusual primate was posted on social media in 2019. Rupert and her co-authors decided to work out the systematic position of the mystery monkey. First, they surveyed the authors of her photographs and the guides working on the banks of the Kinabatangan River. It turns out that the monkey that identified the female was seen three times between June 2017 and November 2018. In two cases, there were grizzly body parts near her. Another photo-backed message about meeting her came in September 2020. By this time, the adult female had acquired her own offspring. Photographers and guides told the researchers that they had seen mixed groups of monkeys consisting of gribby fins and carnivores (Nasalis larvatus) repeatedly on Kinabatangan. Moreover, there was a case of a male carrier mating with a female body. Based on these observations, Rupert and his colleagues suggested that the mystery monkey was a hybrid of carrier and thinner body. Since zoologists had no biological specimens of the unusual primate, they could not determine its origin by genetic methods. Instead, the authors carefully analyzed the available photographs of this individual. It turns out that it combines features typical of carrier and gribby fins. In one respect, the individual is closer to the carrier, while in another, the person is closer to the thinner body. For example, the face of a mystery monkey is more like a female mammal's face, but with a relatively short nose and gray skin. The long, thick wool resembles a thin-bodied wool, but without a characteristic groove on the sides. The female's color and morphometric indexes also proved to be intermediate between the characteristics of the suckler and the thin body. Rupert and her colleagues believe that the evidence they gathered is enough to make the mystery monkey a first-generation hybrid between a carrier and a thin body. The authors point out that this is only the second known case of interracial hybridization in wild primates. At the same time, the genus Nasalis and Trachypithecus have long since split. Experts estimate that this was at the end of the myocene, about 9.21 million years ago. For comparison, the breeding of the genera Theropithecus and Papio, which can also interbreed in the wild, occurred two and a half times later, about 4.07 million years ago. Unlike many hybrids, the mystery monkey is not infertile. The fact that she was seen with a baby indicates that. According to Ruppert and her co-authors, the baby's father was a male of a grivy, thin body. Thus, when a child grows up, he will look more like a skinny person than his mother. Similar cases of hybridization may have occurred before, but to find out, we need to look carefully for traces of carrier genes in the genome of the subtle bodies. Although the hybrid monkey is of great interest to scientists, photographers, and tourists, its appearance can be a warning sign. The fact is that the jungles around the Kinabatangan River are heavily fragmented due to the growth of palm plantations. As a result, several species of local apes have to flee the narrow strip of wet forest along the coast. In such conditions, the male carrier often leaves their groups in search of better sites, and their place is taken by single carriers who begin mating with females of another species (moreover, male carriers can simply drive smaller male carrier carrier from their groups). Combined with increased competition, this can lead to one species simply dissolving in another in the remaining forest fragments. Animals of different species cross much more often in captivity than in the wild. Paleogenetics have recently discovered that the earliest hybrid domestic animals were the descendants of wild donkeys (Equus africanus) and Syrian kulaks (E. The hemippus of the hemisphere . They were brought out by early bronze age breeders around 26002200 BC. Sergei Kelenov"

    "translated_title": "The spiral structure of the cells protected the shell of ginkgo from cracks .",
    "translated_text": "The bark of ginkgo seeds is the best natural material to resist cracking. Chinese scientists have found that this shell resistance is provided by the spiral-like microstructure of the scleroid walls, the dead cells from which the shell is built. This structure allows for efficient redistribution of mechanical stress between neighboring sclerides. The results of the study were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The formation and development of cracks in a material depends on many parameters, including the microstructure of the material. For example, if it has a second, softer and narrower phase (matrix), it slows down the growth of cracks, reducing the mechanical stress. But in the small grain materials without the matrix, the crack can crack and develop on top of each new grain. To find out how to increase the resistance to cracks, scientists study natural materials. For example, wood is well resistant to cracks when the tension is applied perpendicular to the fibers (the torso cuts down a standing tree). However, if the voltage is applied parallel to the fibers, the exact opposite is true. The crack spreads rapidly, and nothing can stop it. Chinese material scientists led by Qunfeng Cheng of Baekhan University have become interested in another natural material  the bark of ginkgo seeds. It has one of the highest corrosion viscosity ratios among natural materials  This parameter describes what mechanical stresses in the material must be created to make the cracking growth fast and unlimited. In this case, there is no anisotropy, as in the case of wood, that is, the shell of ginkgo resists cracks equally in all directions. Ginkgo bilobas is the last member of the genus Ginkgo, a leafy, hollow relic plant. The seeds grow to 1-2 centimeters, resembling the shape of an apricot bone. The seed pods are about a millimeter thick and are composed of polygonal sclerides (dead cells) tightly attached to each other. They're laid out in layers, relatively chaotic, each scleroid in contact with about five or six neighbors. The walls of the scleride are made of 5-7 nanometre thick cellulose fibers, which are found in the matrix of the softer lignin and hemicellulose. Chen and his colleagues studied the ginkgo shell using X-ray microthomography with a synchrotron source and found that the shape of the scleroid changes significantly as it moves from the shell's inner surface to the outer surface. Three areas can be identified: the inner (36 percent of the thickness) of the sclerides have a length-width ratio of about 5.3, the average (55 percent of the thickness) of this ratio is 3.2 and the outer (9 percent of the thickness) of the sclerides are less dense, and the shell material itself is more porous. The authors suggested that the outer porous part contributes little to strength and crack resistance, and focused on the inner and middle areas. Further analysis of the scleroid walls showed that the cellulose fibers in them are spiral. The neighbouring sclerodes are closely related, as the walls wrap around each other as they thicken. Spiral channels form between the neighbouring sclerides. As the seed grows and its shell thickens, these channels are used to transport water and nutrients. Chen and his colleagues suggested that the channels of this shape evolved in the ginkgo, including to increase strength and resistance to cracks. The sclerides that are hit are partially rotated and transmit some of the voltage to the neighbors through the channels. They also partly spin and, in turn, share the tension with their neighbors. Transmission can occur in all three directions, both within a single layer and deep within the layers to thicker sclerides. The result is a voltage drop and the cracking spreads slower. Chen and his colleagues hope that the cracks blocking mechanism described can be replicated in artificial materials. Many scientists are skilled at making handmade materials look like natural ones. For example, last week we wrote about how Canadian materials scientists were inspired by the texture of penguin feathers and created a waterproof, ice-tight steel mesh coating. And two years ago, a Chinese team developed a composite material made of cellulose and slides that looks like a layered pearl. The composite was resistant to mechanical loads and heating, but at the same time plastic."

    "translated_text": "Astronomers from the CHIME collaboration have discovered the longest-lasting fast radio burst FRB 20191221A, which lasted almost 3 seconds and consisted of 9 components. Scientists believe that the properties of this radio burst are consistent with the model of radiation generation inside the magnetosphere of a neutron star. The article was published in Nature. Rapid radio bursts are milliseconds of radiation, whose brightness is so strong that their sources can be seen at distances of billions of light-years. This phenomenon was discovered in 2007, and since then several hundred rapid radio bursts have been recorded, both single and repeated. The nature of their ancestors and the mechanism of their generation remain unsolved problems in modern astrophysics, possibly related to magnets. To solve these problems, astronomers are looking for new sources of bursts and trying to determine their properties and location. A team of astronomers led by Daniele Michilli of the Kavli Institute of Astrophysics and Space Studies reported the record for the longest fast radio burst FRB 20191221A, which also stands out among others for its multi-component nature. It was detected in observational data from the CHIME ground radio interferometer in Canada, which conducted systematic studies of rapid radio bursts at frequencies of 400800 megahertz, in December 2019. The dispersion measure (the magnitude of the \"switch\" time of the signal's arrival depending on the frequency of the wave) for FRB 20191221A is about 4 times the maximum value expected by models for the Milky Way, with no star formation regions in the direction of the burst source, so the burst source is in another galaxy. The total burst time was about three seconds, and it has at least nine overlapping components with a distance of 216.8 milliseconds between them. No further spikes from FRB 20191221A were detected. Scientists have suggested that the properties of the burst support the idea that radio radiation is generated in the magnetosphere of a neutron star (a radio pulsar or magnet), rather than in regions farther away from it, as some models predict. You can read about what fast radio bursts can be and why they're interesting to study on our blog. Alexander Voytyk"

    "translated_text": "History's film crew has discovered a large fragment of the Challenger shuttle that crashed in 1986 at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. NASA has confirmed the find's shuttle. It is noteworthy that the experts were hoping to find not a spacecraft but an aircraft that disappeared in 1945 while searching for other missing aircraft. The Challenger disaster was the first of two in the history of the Space Shuttle program, the second occurring in 2003 when the Columbia shuttle crashed while returning to Earth. The last launch of Challenger took place on January 28, 1986. The flight started normally, but in the second minute, the system, consisting of the spacecraft itself, the fuel tank and the side accelerators, crashed. As a result of the accident, all seven crew members died. The investigation revealed that the immediate cause of the accident was the destruction of the side accelerator element, which caused the gas stream to hit the fuel tank. The Commission of Inquiry identified the low decision-making culture at NASA as the root cause of the disaster, which did not address a design deficiency known even before the shuttle's first flight into orbit. Soon after the incident, search teams found many pieces of the Challenger, including a cabin with crew. The wreckage is about half the ship. Now another big piece was accidentally found by a film crew for History. Filming took place in March and the original goal was to search for the Martin PBM Mariner plane, which disappeared on December 5, 1945. It is noteworthy that the purpose of this flight was also to search for the missing Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo boat. All five planes disappeared in the Sargasso Sea area, which is also known as the Bermuda Triangle. During a dive off the coast of Florida, the film crew discovered an unusual object resembling a shuttle's heat shield. In May, they re-examined the site with a third-party expert, and then they forwarded the information to NASA. After studying the footage, NASA confirmed in August that the filming team had found a large (about 4.5 by 4.5 meters) fragment of the Challenger. Although all the shuttle fragments found are considered to be the agency's property until it decides what to do with the new find. The network says the group has been able to locate fragments of ships and aircraft. The film with more details about them, as well as the likely shuttle, will be released on November 22. Researchers were able to find so many fragments of Challenger because it failed to reach orbit during takeoff. And usually, fragments of spacecraft burn up when they enter the atmosphere, but that's not always the case. Scientists have recently estimated that within the next decade, the likelihood of human casualties from missile wrecks is 10 percent."

    "translated_title": "Metallynz generated and focused the vacuum ultraviolet",
    "translated_text": "Physicists have created a metallic lens that simultaneously generates and focuses coherent radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet. They used zinc oxide-based metatoms to generate a second harmonic. The study was published in Science Advances. Light is a common tool for studying or impacting small objects and materials. However, optical methods limit the diffraction limit, which prevents the light beam from being compressed into a spot smaller than the wavelength. Because of this effect, it is impossible to see nanoparticles and atoms in a microscope, and optical lithography is unable to create nanostructured patterns. The obvious way out of this situation was to use less-wavelength radiation. The visible range was replaced by ultraviolet. However, starting at about two hundred nanometers, ultraviolet optics encountered a strong absorption of radiation from the environment, including air. To work with this light, the air in the device must be turned off, so this range of ultraviolet light is called vacuum. Working with vacuum ultraviolet (UVF) faces the problem of optical component losses and the lack of compact coherent sources. There are only a few materials that can pass through UFOs, like calcium fluorides and magnesium fluorides, but they're relatively fragile, which prevents lensing from using them. The use of mirror optics solves this problem, but it greatly increases the volume and complexity of UV systems. The same difficulties are experienced in laser light generation in the UV range. For this purpose, either bulky eximer lasers are used, or higher harmonics are generated in crystals and gases, which are heavily limited by the requirements of phase synchronization at UFOs. Ming Lun Tseng of Yang Min National University, with colleagues from Hong Kong, the United States, and Taiwan, took a completely different approach to tackling both of these problems at the same time. They created a compact nonlinear metallic material that simultaneously generated coherent UV radiation and focused it to a point. This way, the radiation was able to squeeze into a spot just under two micrometers in size. A bundle of parallel light begins to focus or disfocus when its wave front from the plane becomes spherical (flowing or diverging). For this, the wave phase must vary according to the distance to the beam axis. In conventional lenses, this is achieved by using a variable thickness. Metallysis works on a different principle: its individual elements  metatoms are responsible for the phase properties of the wavefront. In the work of physicists, the metatoms were the zinc oxide nanoparticles, made in the form of a triangular prism with a thickness of 150 nanometers and a side of 205 nanometers, on the surface of the glass substrate. These structures had unusual nonlinear properties: they doubled the frequency of light falling on them if it had a wavelength of 394 nanometers and a circular polarization. The radiation emanating from the metatoms had opposite polarisation and a wavelength of 197 nanometers, and the wave phase depended on the orientation of the nanoprism on the substrate. Physicists used the latter property and placed 8,400 metatoms on a substrate 45 micrometers in diameter to form a converging wave front. Measuring the light characteristics created by the metal lens showed that it focuses UV radiation into a spot with a diameter of 1.7 micrometers and a length along the axis of 25 micrometers. These values were slightly higher than the calculation: 0.64 micrometers and 15 micrometers, respectively. In addition, the focus increased the intensity of light in the brightest pixels by 21 times instead of the calculated 100. The authors linked this to defects in the manufacture of the metallic, and also to the imperfectly flat-panel. However, even with such defects, the metallic material can be integrated into existing systems used in biomedical, materials science and nanolithography. Metallines and composite lenses allow physicists to work in a variety of known electromagnetic ranges. In addition to ultraviolet, infrared, visible and X-ray ranges are also included.

    "translated_title": "Primitive agriculture was introduced to the ancient inhabitants of China no later than 8,300 years ago .",
    "translated_text": "Biarchaeologists analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and found the diets of the Neolithic Hooli and Basin cultures. It turns out that ancient hunter-gatherers from China used some C4-photosynthesis plants as early as 8,300 years ago. This, scientists say, indicates that they had a primitive grain-based agriculture. At least 6,000 years ago, this type of economy was already dominant. This is reported in an article published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. Recent research suggests that common wheat (Panicum miliaceum) and rye (Setaria italica) were domesticated about ten thousand years ago. The earliest evidence of this was found by archaeologists during excavations of monuments on the Great Plain of China. For example, ancient grains of prosaic starch were found in the cultural layer, on fragments of ceramics and stone tools excavated at the monuments of Nanchjuangto and Dunhuolin. It seems that the transition from wild grain harvesting to farming took several millennia. In the early Neolithic period, about 6500-5500 BC, the Hōuli culture was established in the Shandong province of China, named after the base monument of the same name. Although the people's economy continued to be based on hunting, gathering, and fishing, they were already skilled at making pottery, keeping dogs and pigs, and probably growing small amounts of grain. It was replaced by the Basin culture, which existed from about the beginning of the fourth millennium BC. The study of her monuments showed that during this period people increasingly relied on productive farming. A group of Chinese scientists led by Yi Guo of Zhejiang University decided to find out the diet of people living in the lower Huanghe River in the Neolithic era from the Hooli culture to the Baisin culture (about 80006000 years ago). To do this, they analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in human and animal bone collagen, and they obtained radiocarbon dating for these remains. The materials for this study were found during excavations of the Hooli Monument in Shandong Province. Radiocarbon analysis showed that the Hooli culture man lived about 83238178 years ago, and the two Baisin culture men lived about 59875726 years ago. Studies of stable isotopes have shown some differences in the diet of people living in these two periods. For example, Hoolians consumed mostly plant-based foods, with plants with C3-photosynthesis and C4-photosynthesis. They had little animal protein in their diet. Biarchaeologists noted that these people probably already started to cultivate primitive livestock, as well as breeding some animals (such as pigs), but their economy continued to be based on hunting and gathering. A study of the remains of the Baisin people showed that they also ate mostly plant-based foods, and their diet remained stable for a long period of life. Scientists believe that during this period, the basis of the human diet was already the wheat, suggesting that 6,000 years ago, agriculture in the region was based on growing this grain. In addition, the paleontological evidence suggests that these people regularly kept not only dogs but also pigs in their settlements. Previously on N+1, we talked about other studies of ancient human nutrition. For example, bioarchaeologists have figured out the diet of the first Greek farmers, and have also found that the Neolithic inhabitants of Prebaykalya ate fish and nerps.

    "translated_title": "Archaeologists have copied Tagar and Thesine tools and practiced petroglyphs",
    "translated_text": "Novosibirsk archaeologists have created copies of Tagar and Thesine metal tools to find out which of them the ancient inhabitants of Siberia could use when creating rock drawings in the technique of picketing. After conducting experiments and studying the traces of wear on the tools, the researchers concluded that for these purposes, universal tools made of tin-plated bronze and hardened steel were used. Among them were a long-snouted weapon, a spear-shaped gun, a gun-shaped gun, and a sharp-edged instrument. This is reported in an article published in the journal Archaeology, Ethnography and Anthropology of Eurasia. In the VIIIIII centuries BC, the territory of the Minusine Kottlovina and the Achinsk-Maryin forest steppe was the site of a Tagar archaeological culture. It belongs to the cultural circle of the so-called Scythian-Siberian world, which unites a common triad: similar weapons, elements of horse-drawn equipment, as well as an animal art style. The Tagar people were likely sedentary or semi-sedentary and engaged in a complex economy, with livestock being the main occupation. For example, paleohisological evidence suggests that they mainly raised cattle, sheep, horses, and goats. Although scholars trace the Tagar culture to the early Iron Age, most metal products were made from copper alloys. Iron objects are represented by a fairly small circle of finds. From the Tagar people to the present day, many art objects have survived, one of which is petroglyphs. The most impressive monument of rock art of this culture is the Boyar Writers, located in the Bograd district of the Republic of Khakassia and first discovered by scientists in 1904. There are numerous animal figures, such as deer, goats, bulls and horses. In addition, the scripts contain images of people, wooden houses, yards and bronze boilers. And these petroglyphs make up a whole story. Lydia Zotkina and Roman Davydov of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences have investigated Tagorean and Thesine metal tools that could potentially be used to create petroglyphs in picketing techniques. To do this, they made copies of ancient instruments that are kept in museum collections. Among them were sharp-edged and gold-shaped tools, dental flint, spear-shaped flint and copper and bronze-made cheques, as well as sharp-edged iron tools. In total, the scientists made 11 copper and bronze copies, and another eight were made of low-carbon steel. Archaeologists then conducted a series of experiments on the devon sandstone found in the Kuragina district of Krasnoyarsk Territory, using each tool until it became unfit for work. The researchers noted that copper tools were worn out very quickly  just a few strokes later the work edge was rendered unusable. At the same time, the tin bronze and iron products were comparable in efficiency. For example, a bronze gun could be used to make an image of about 1015 square centimeters without any renovation. Scientists have noted that the most expressive traces on the sandstone, similar to the Tagar ones, were left with the help of dolt-like and string-like weapons. At the same time, they found that bronze cheques were not as suitable for these purposes as stainless steel guns. In total, the researchers created 76 samples of picketage using experimental tools, then compared the resulting carvings with Tagore and Thessine images, and also conducted a tracological analysis of wear traces on the tools. They found similar traces of wear on several items from the collection of the Minusini Landscape Museum. Among them were the Tagar bronze barrel-like tools, the spear-like dolt and the dolt-like tool, as well as the Thessin iron sharp-edged tool. According to the researchers, the Tagarans used bronze tools of various shapes to create petroglyphs. The context of these finds is missing. They all came to the museum in the late 19th century as a lifting material. Archaeologists also noted that it is impossible to rule out the use of stone tools for picketing, as past experiences have shown their effectiveness and wear resistance. Earlier, N + 1 reported on the discovery of new petroglyphs in different parts of Russia. For example, archaeologists have discovered a rock image of a northern deer in Chucotte. And on Enisei, they found two rock images of pregnant women."

    "translated_title": "Four species of earthworms have been found in the 99 million-year-old Myanmar jantar",
    "translated_text": "In the Burmese ant, estimated to be about 99 million years old, paleontologists have discovered four new species of earthworms, or earthworms. Two of them were adapted to a full-fledged digging lifestyle for the first time among the fossil population. The study was published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. Earthworms, or earthworms (Cydnidae) are a family of worms, most of whose species are related to the soil. However, little is known about when they began to adapt to the changing lifestyle. In the paleontological record, earth shields are known from the early mel to the early myocene, but these fossil species either have no adaptation to life in the soil or are poorly expressed. Paleontologists from China and the United States, led by Yunzhi Yao of the Beijing Capital University of Education, have described four new species of earthen shields from the 99 million-year-old Burmese amber that is mined in northern Myanmar. Scientists have named them Acanthamnestus atridorsus, A. The species is known as ovoideus, Laevigemma lisorum and Quinalveus hui. Researchers note that modern pimples have two signs of digging: first, a flattened head with spike-like and hairy patches; second, flattened and expanded distal ends with the neck of the first pair of limbs  and the legs, while being spread by thick spikes. Based on the degree of their expressiveness, the authors have identified three morphotypes among modern and fossil earthworms. The first morphotype lacks all of the above. The second has a flattened head, but only hairy brows; the buttocks are covered with thin spikes, and their distal ends are only slightly enlarged. Finally, the third morphotype has all the features fully developed. Modern representatives of the first morphotype live mainly on plants, representatives of the second are able to dig, but live mainly on the surface of the soil, and representatives of the third morphotype  are typical soil inhabitants. Researchers believe that this was also the case with fossil earthworms. The L. species Lisorum and Q. The scientists put the second one, and A. Atridorsus and A. ovoideus to the third morphotype. Thus, in the paleontological record, real excavators are first discovered among earthen shields. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the genus Acanthamnestus belongs to the subfamily Amnestinae. Some modern species of this subfamily (from the genus Amnestus) live in the soil near plants of the pea family (Moraceae), such as figs, and feed on their fallen fruits. The authors note that the amnestic fossil range intersects with the totem (or their primitive relatives) fossil range. This suggests that these organisms may have been closely related in the early stages. Moreover, it is possible that it was the diet of fallen fruit of the totus that contributed to the shift to the roaring lifestyle in amnestics (the authors believe that different groups of earthworms adapted to life in the soil independently). We recently wrote about the discovery in the Burmese antler of the walker termit with a winged individual with soldier marks. The Seed of Frost"

    "translated_title": "In the early iron age burial, a stone age carving was discovered.",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have discovered in the burial of the Urnpoll culture of the early Iron Age (about 750550 years before our era) a stone carving, which according to its characteristics belongs to the culture of linear-lined ceramics of the Neolithic era. Scientists suggested that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from modern-day Poland may have replaced this tool with early farmers. A few millennia later, it was found in the culture of the burial-places, and they used it as a companion piece of equipment. This is reported in an article published in the magazine Antiquity. In the late bronze and early iron age (about 1300500/450 BC) in Central Europe there was a culture (more precisely a number of cultures) of burial urn fields (Urnopol culture), which replaced the culture of the gurgan burials. Its designation is due to the common tradition of burial of the dead. For example, most burials were in earthen-cut tombs, where the remains were usually cremated and placed in earthen vessels. The representatives of the Urnpols culture often settled on the top of hills or on the banks of rivers, around which they built defensive structures  wooden fortifications and walls of stones or logs. Their economy was based on growing barley, wheat, and barley, as well as raising cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. Archaeologists have discovered a large number of treasures related to Urnpols culture. The tribes of this community often left their offerings to the gods in rivers or swamps. For example, in the German city of Franklben, 200 serps and 16 bronze axes were discovered in the middle of the last century, and they had virtually no trace of use. And it was not only humans who found such treasures, but also animals. In 2018, in the north of the Czech Republic, a dog found more than 20 artefacts of Urnpols culture, made about three thousand years ago. Bernadeta Kufel-Diakowska, together with colleagues from the University of Wrocław, studied the materials discovered during excavations of the large Miloslavite-6 tomb found in the southwest of the country. According to archaeologists, the monument was buried by the representatives of the Urnpols culture in the late bronze and early iron ages. During excavations of the burial site in 527, researchers discovered a large urn with a ceramic plate decorated with fingerprints. The urn contained cremated human and animal remains (561 g). In addition, 25 smaller vessels were located nearby. According to the typology of these artifacts, archaeologists dated the burial to 750550 BC. In addition to the ceramics, the tomb contained stone carvings, characteristic of the Neolithic linear-bent ceramics culture. It is a stone tool measuring 142×33,6×22,6 millimeters, made from metabaseite (metamorphic mountain rock). According to the researchers, similar raw materials are known to have been produced in the Jezreel Mountains, about 200 kilometers from the cemetery. The closest known tools are from the cremation burials of linear-lined ceramics, excavated near Krakow, about 300 kilometers from the new find. In addition, Neolithic textiles were used again in the Age of Enolith as stone axes. According to scientists, the Miloslavitsa-6 cemetery is outside the main settlements of the linear-lined ceramics culture, but still not far from several stops of the Age of Enniotic. However, archaeologists have noted that the area where the tomb is located was densely populated during the Mesolithic era. Although there is little evidence of contact between local hunter-gatherers and the first farmers of Central and Northwestern Europe, there is some evidence. For example, in a Mesolithic burial mound excavated in Germany, a stone canvas was found, typical of the linear-poly ceramic culture. It may have been exchanged in the area of the Miloslavite-6 cemetery. And long after the burial, the tools were reused by the early Iron Age as a companion piece of equipment. Previously on N+1, we'd already talked about finds related to the culture of the burial urn fields. A Czech farmer recently discovered a 49x9 centimeter gold belt in a beetroot field. And last year, in Austria, they found a rare gold cup with a solar symbol, about 3,000 to 3,000 years old."

    "translated_title": "Little Japanese and American helped to uncover cultural differences in the soap test",
    "translated_text": "Researchers in the United States and Japan have found that culture can influence the time children wait for a reward in a modified sour cream test, with some children receiving a gift and some receiving a candy. It turns out that American children are willing to wait longer for a gift than food, while young Japanese are willing to wait for the opposite. The description of the experiments with 58 American and 80 Japanese children aged 4-5 years was published in Psychological Science. Children's self-control is often tested with a zephyr test. The initial experiment was conducted in the 1960s and 1970s: the researchers offered the children the choice of eating a zefir/confection/cookie at the same time or waiting about 15 minutes (at that time the researcher was leaving the room) and getting twice as much. It is believed that this task reflects the ability to defer reward (delayed gratification), which is associated with self-regulation  the ability to control your emotions, behavior, and attention. The results of a child's zephyr test are tied to their future abilities: SAT scores, academic achievement, and even body mass index. However, scientists also talk about the impact of external factors on test results and the power of linking to future successes. For example, earlier studies have shown that these parameters can be influenced by poverty or parenting, and the conditions of the experiment: children tend to delay enjoyment longer if they are dependent on someone else. In addition, American scientists have shown that a mother's education influences the level of prediction of a child's academic performance in the future. All of this raises questions about the test's reliability. Now a team of American and Japanese psychologists led by Kaichi Yanao has decided to investigate how cultural habits can contribute to delaying reward in a familiar context. The study involved 58 children from the U.S. and 80 children from Japan aged 4-5 who were randomly assigned to either a group with a edible award (zefir) or a group with an unedible award (a cow with a gift). In both groups, the experimenter asked parents to go to a separate room and fill out a questionnaire about their children's eating habits. The children were in the experiment room and they were painting the pictures for the first eight minutes, and then the main part of the experiment started. The experimenter put a gift box or a gift plate in front of the child and told the child that he had a choice: get the gift now or wait and get twice as much. After that, the researcher left the room and watched the child for 15 minutes, and then a video was recorded. In addition to the test itself, the authors asked the children to take a questionnaire to assess their behavior and social norms, focus and brake control, and how much they enjoy the rewards (zefir/opening a gift). For the analysis of the video, the researchers used a double-coding method in which two experts estimated the time between the experimenter leaving the room and completing the test. The end result was: the child said he wanted one reward, the child tried or ate a saffron/opened a box, the child or parent started to worry or the child lasted 15 minutes. The test results showed significant differences in the resistance of American and Japanese children (p = 0.002). American children were willing to wait longer to open a gift (median 14.54 minutes) than to eat a zephyr (median 3.66 minutes). Japanese children, on the other hand, were able to resist the urge to eat a treat (median of 15 minutes) longer than they were to open a gift (median of 4.62). According to a survey of parents answering questions about their children, Japanese children were more willing to wait until the table was filled and adults allowed to eat. In addition, in both cultures, children who were more sensitive to social norms were able to wait for rewards longer (p = 0.007), as were children with a higher level of brake control (p = 0.004). American kids rated how much they enjoy opening presents and eating soap higher than Japanese kids. While U.S. children prefer to open gifts to eating sapphires (p = 0.027), researchers in Japan found no difference in the preferences of children. The authors have shown that Japanese children are three times more likely to resist the urge to eat sapphires than Americans, which confirms the existence of cultural differences in the way they pass the sapphires test and suggests that eating habits influence the outcome of their child's delayed reward test when it is done with food.

    "translated_title": "Zoologist takes the first black Canadian rat on video",
    "translated_text": "Zoologist Thomas Jung described the first known case of melaninism in the Canadian trout. The scientist encountered a rare-colored predator in the Canadian territory of Yukon and captured it on video. As noted in an article for the magazine Mammalia, earlier melaninists were among the smaller red ridges. Melanism is a common occurrence among felines (Felidae). Species with unusually dark color are known to every third species of this predator. Among them, for example, are the famous black panthers  the melantic individuals of the leopard (Panthera pardus) and the jaguar (P. Onca), and also black domestic cats (Felis catus). Zoologists suggest that the dark coloration makes wild cat melonists less noticeable in dense vegetation, especially at night, allowing them to more efficiently sneak up on prey. However, on the other hand, these individuals do not have white spots on their ears, which prevents them from sending visual signals to their relatives. Perhaps this factor limits the proportion of melanin in wild cat populations. Unlike many other cats, the color of the lynx is variable within the species. However, over the last century, about twenty melantic individuals of the North American red rhino (L. The rufus . They originated mainly from the southern and northern boundaries of the range of this species. And the zoologist Thomas Jung (Thomas S. Jung) of the University of Alberta described the first known case of melaninism in another species of Canadian (L. The canadensis . These cats are usually red-brown in summer and silver-grey in winter. However, in late August 2020, Jung met a very dark-colored Canadian rhinoceros in a surrounded taiga settlement in the Canadian territory of Yukon. The animal's body, especially on the backbars and along the ridge, was covered with lighter hairs. Rise was not afraid of the presence of people and their dog, so Jung was able to record a 30-second video with her on her smartphone camera. However, the predator did not like the loud dog bark, so she soon retired. Unfortunately, the video quality was not enough to judge the field and age of the feature. Nevertheless, it is important as the first documented evidence of melaninism in this species. No one has ever seen a panther before in Canadian raccoons, either in sight or using a photo trap. Even the hunters who have been hunting thousands of these cats for fur every year for centuries have never reported the melanin species. Jung suggests that unlike the black panther, the melanin is unlikely to benefit from its unusual coloration. Although in theory such a person will be well disguised from hunting American whitefish (Lepus americanus) in recently burned forests, it will be perfectly visible on the snow, depriving it of any chance of stealing the victim unnoticed. We have previously discussed how the conservation measures have helped to increase the number of rare Pyrenean rays (L. Pardinus) from Spain and Portugal were able to bring up to a thousand and more individuals. And in Scotland, where the common features (L. Lynx) died out over 500 years ago, recently thought about returning."

    "translated_title": "Paleogeneticists have read ancient DNA from a 4,000-year-old strand of Sudanese hair",
    "translated_text": "Paleogenetics have read ancient DNA from a strand of human hair about four thousand years old, which was found in Sudan during excavations of Kadruk-1 monument. It turns out that this man was genetically related to the early cattle herders of East Africa. This is consistent with archaeological evidence of settlement of cattle from north to south along the Nile valley. This is reported in an article published in the journal Scientific Reports. Ancient DNA analysis methods have been developing rapidly in recent decades. This year, one of the pioneers in the field, Svante Paabo, was awarded the Nobel Prize (see \"The Man Who Collected Ancient Ones\"). Over the years, researchers have gone from trying to isolate DNA fragments from mummified tissue to reading the complete mitochondrial and then the nuclear genomes of ancient humans: Neanderthals, Cromannians, and Denisovans. Scientists usually use samples from teeth or rocky bones for this purpose, but in recent years they have learned to extract DNA from both cave debris and calcite. Much less often, hair and soft tissue studies are used to analyze ancient DNA, since it is generally thought that it is better preserved in teeth and bones. But the first complete mitochondrial genome of an ancient human was read through the sequencing of DNA from frozen hair of a Greenlandic individual who belonged to the Sackcock culture and lived about 4,750 years ago. Since then, scientists have read more than 6,000 ancient genomes, and that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, only a very small proportion of these remains are in Africa, where the DNA is poorly preserved due to the hot and dry conditions. A group of scientists from the UK and Germany led by Stephan Schiffels of the Max Planck Society's Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology attempted to extract ancient DNA from the bones, teeth and hair of four people who lived during the Middle Holocene in Upper Nubia. The remains of three of them were found on the Neolithic monument of Kadruk-21, which is about seven thousand years old. The remains of the fourth individual come from the Kadruk-1 monument, which dates back to the later times when Kerma culture existed. Radiocarbon analysis showed that this man died about 41393928 years ago. Of all the materials examined, only one sample of hair from the Kadruk-1 monument has retained a sufficient amount of ancient DNA, although very damaged. And for her research, scientists had to resort to a new protocol to build a single-stranded DNA library, which created additional difficulties in genetic analysis. The main component method showed that the profile of this individual is close to the previously published genomes of early East African cattle ranchers. Among them were individuals from modern-day Kenya who lived 40003800 and 30001500 years ago at a distance of about 2500 kilometers from the Kadruk-1 monument. The close connection with early livestock populations from East Africa, according to researchers, is consistent with archaeological evidence of settlement of livestock from north to south along the Nile valley. Perhaps this individual was one of the group that produced the first herders to settle in the East African Rift Valley. F3 statistics indicate that the man from Kadruk-1 most closely resembles the ancient Levantine populations, the ancient northern and eastern Africans, as well as modern Africans living in the Northern Sahara and the Somali Peninsula (the Horn of Africa). The researchers concluded that the results showed that ancient DNA could be extracted from hair that had been exposed to heat and drought for a long time. The DNA readings were only preserved in very short fragments. So this study didn't look at fragments longer than 25 pairs of bases because they probably represented modern pollution. Previously, N+1 was about archaeological research in Upper Nubia. Scientists then managed to discover 142 Neolithic burials in the tomb of Kadruk-23. All the graves contained accompanying equipment, including beans made of sardonic pulp, agate and shell, as well as stone and bone tools."

    "translated_title": "The conductive membrane helped reduce carbon dioxide losses during electrolysis",
    "translated_text": "Chemists in the U.S. have found a way to reduce carbon dioxide losses in the process of electrolytic recovery. They used a membrane conducting proton to prevent carbonate anions from moving into anodic space and mixing with oxygen. As a result, carbon dioxide conversion has increased, scientists write in Nature Catalysis. Carbon dioxide can be converted into valuable organic compounds by electrolysis. Chemists have already found electric catalysts to selectively extract carbon dioxide, ethylene, and even propane from it. In the process of electrolytic recovery, carbon dioxide at the cathode is converted into an organic product, and two hydroxide anions are formed in parallel. At the same time, the water molecules are oxidized to oxygen at the anode, and two hydrogenated protons are released for each oxidized water molecule. So, a lot of hydrated H+ ions pass into the solution around the anode, and it becomes more acidic. Instead, the OH− ions pass into the solution near the anode, and the environment becomes more alkaline. When the carbon dioxide enters the alkaline environment near the anode during electrolysis, it partially dissolves and reacts with hydroxide anions, forming carbonate anions of CO32. They remain in solution and can gradually penetrate the anode space. There, because of the acidic environment, they are converted into unstable carbonic acid, which dissolves in water and carbon dioxide. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide is mixed with oxygen, which is also released at the anode. This mixture of gases cannot be re-introduced into the electrolysis because oxygen will interfere with recovery. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide is wasted, and the efficiency of the process drops. Wang Haotian and his colleagues at Rice University have addressed the problem of carbon dioxide transition to anodic space. They first modeled the electrolysis reaction. CO2 was recovered to CO2 in the presence of silver nanotubes. Chemists analyzed the gas mixture that was spotted on the anode using gas chromatography. It turns out it has twice as much carbon dioxide as it does oxygen. That is, about half of the dissolved carbon dioxide does not go into the electrolysis reaction, but is converted into carbonate anions, and then released back into the oxygen mixture. To overcome this problem, chemists proposed that a solid polymer membrane with sulfonate groups be placed between the cathode and the anode, through which protons from the anode space can penetrate quickly. Scientists thought that in this case, carbonate anions would be converted to carbon dioxide in advance, before reaching the anode. To test their hypothesis, chemists assembled an electrolyser with a polymer conductive membrane that was constantly washed with water during electrolysis. This water was then titrated to contain different forms of carbon dioxide. The gas from the membrane, which was not soluble in water, was collected by water-suppressing. Electrolysis was carried out at current values of 50 to 500 milliamps per square centimeter, and silver nanotubes were again used as a catalyst. Chemists measured the volume of gas released on the membrane at different current values and compared it with theoretical values. It turns out they were able to collect 90 to 100 percent of the gas at different current values. Gas chromatography showed that 99 percent of the gas released is CO2, and it can be re-electrocuted. Then the chemists changed their approach. Now all the gas that was released from the membrane was going back to the cathode space. The scientists measured the CO2 conversion and current output. When chemists reduced the flow of carbon dioxide, the current output dropped, but the conversion increased, and when the flow increased, the conversion increased. As a result, the authors have achieved a 91 percent conversion of carbon dioxide to 60 percent current. The flow rate of carbon dioxide was 2.6 milliliters per minute. Scientists also managed to maintain a 60 percent carbon dioxide conversion at 85 percent current. This has kept the balance between high output and higher conversion than the systems we already know. In a reaction that American chemists have investigated, the addition of oxygen prevents the recovery of carbon dioxide. But there are times when it's the other way around. We talked recently about how a small amount of oxygen helped electro-synthesize ammonia. Michael Boim"

    "translated_title": "The most expensive drug in the world is a new beta-thalassemia therapy. One shot is worth $2.8 million .",
    "translated_text": "The United States has approved gene therapy for beta-thalassemia, a hereditary blood disease. The drug's developer, Bluebird bio, claims that one injection is enough to make a patient's condition significantly better if left untreated. But that injection would cost $2.8 million. It's $700,000 more expensive than the Zolgensma injection from the previous holder of the title of \"world's most expensive medicine\". Until recently, the drug for spinal muscular atrophy was considered the most expensive drug ever. Treatment for it consists of a single injection that provides the body with a healthy copy of the gene and should prevent the disease from developing. But this injection itself is worth a little over two million dollars. We talked about how this happened in the article \"A Two Million Shot\". Now Zolgensma is down to second place, and the first one is a new drug, Zynteglo from Bluebird bio. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for beta-talassemia. That treatment would cost $2.8 million. Beta-thalassemia is a hereditary disease in which one of the hemoglobin chains in erythrocytes is low or none at all. Depending on the specific mutation, pathology can manifest itself in many ways, from mild weakness and paleness to serious problems where a person constantly needs donor blood transfusions. Zintego works like a classic ex vivo gene therapy: the patient has blood-forming bone marrow cells removed, treated with viral vectors with the right hemoglobin gene, and then returned to the body. The technology suggests that the cells will be instantly reabsorbed, so it's enough to do the procedure once. At least in clinical trials, the company reports in a press release, 32 of the 36 participants became completely independent of blood transfusions  meaning their blood-forming cells learned to produce enough hemoglobin. The Zolgensma, the previous drug-record maker, justified the high price of the drug in this way: its closest competitor, Spinraz gene therapy, requires repeated administration, and costs a lot of  several hundred thousand a year. So in a few years, the cost of a single shot (if it's effective, of course) will pay off. The Zintego's creators follow roughly the same logic: patients with severe beta-thalassemia need blood transfusions every two weeks, and they spend more than six million dollars on treatment over their lifetimes (which often turns out to be shorter than average). With that figure in mind, 2.8 million doesn't seem that big. It's true, not having a doctor after a single shot of Zintego is not going to work. The manufacturers warn that following gene therapy, there is a risk of developing blood cancer. So those who get the new hemoglobin gene are advised to get tested every year for at least the first 15 years of treatment, and ideally for the rest of their lives. We've already talked about another way to treat beta-thalassemia  using CRISPR/Cas. It also allows for in vitro cell editing, but it's not yet approved for widespread use. Polina Loseva"

    "translated_title": "Spider-Squashes were suspected of having the ability to dream",
    "translated_text": "Zoologists have found that the Evarcha arcuata is a fast-sleep phase analogy in the spider-squirrel. During this time, these vertebrates move their eyelids and support their limbs and body. They may even dream, says a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Many animals sleep through alternating periods of slow and fast sleep. During the fast-sleep phase, which accounts for 25 to 25 percent of a person's total night's sleep, brain activity increases, muscles relax, and eyelids make rapid movements. Rapid sleep was first described in humans about seventy years ago, but it has since been detected in other mammals, birds, reptiles, and even head-footed mollusks. Experts hope that studying fast sleep in animals will help us learn more about its origins and functions. The zoologist Daniel Rossler (Daniela C. Rößler) from the University of Constance decided to look for a phase of rapid sleep in spiders. She and her colleagues recently discovered that the Evarcha arcuata's cockroaches hang down their heads on web threads at night. Since this characteristic posture is combined with complete inactivity, the researchers suggested that this is how spiders sleep. Occasionally, the resting cockroaches bend their limbs and also stick them, their belly, and their webbing warts. Similarly, the spinal cord is exposed to the rapid sleep phase. The snails have no eyeballs that can be seen by their movements to determine that they are in a fast-sleeping phase. Instead, their two main eyes are long tubes with a retina at the back end. To focus on an object, these spiders move their eyelids with specialized muscles (the lens that closes the eye from the outside remains stationary). Roesler and his co-authors suggested that if the spider web moves while resting, these spiders have a rapid sleep phase analogy. To test this idea, the researchers conducted laboratory experiments with young E-squirrels. The arcuata, whose covers are still transparent, allowing you to see the movements of their eyelids directly. The resting spiders, aged one to nine days, were captured on an infrared video camera from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. The authors recorded the movements of their eyelids, as well as the movement of their limbs and bodies. It turns out that during their rest, the snails actually move their eyelids from time to time. The average duration of these phases was 77 seconds, and the intervals between them were about 17 minutes. During the night, the length of the eyelids and the gaps between them gradually increased. During the movement phase of the eyeballs, young spiders bend their limbs, and also support their limbs, belly, and webbed warts. Interestingly, the resting spiders only bend their limbs during periods of eyeball movement, but less than half of the time they do so are accompanied by limb bending. When spiders were active, such as cleaning or repairing the web on which they hung, their eyelids remained stationary. Usually, the pupils cleaned themselves after the phase of eyeball movement; perhaps after that they woke up from sleep. In the next stage, Rossler and his co-authors repeated the experiment with three adult E-squirrels. The arcuata. Because of the pigmentation of the lining, the researchers could not track the movements of their eyeballs. However, they found that, like spiders, adults occasionally start bending or holding their limbs, belly and spinal warts, while resting. The duration of such movements was on average 83 seconds and 91 seconds respectively. The intervals between these phases were roughly equal and averaged 28 minutes. Sometimes the E-boys. Arcuata do not rest on a web of thread, but in a web of shelter or just on the ground. Researchers have found that they bend their legs occasionally in this case as well. And when the authors took pictures of adult spiders resting on the ground using an infrared camera, they could capture how their eyeballs moved at the same time as their limbs were bent. The results of the study show that the spider-squirrel has an analogy to the rapid sleep phase. Like the vertebrates, they have eyes that move during this phase, and they have limbs and body that support them. Even the length of periods that resemble fast sleep and the intervals between them, in cockroaches is about the same as in rats and mice. It's not uncommon for spiders to even dream during the early stages. To learn more about how the animals of different species sleep, take our \"All the animals on earth sleep\" test. Sergei Kelenov"

    "translated_title": "The paddler helped the edmontosaurus mummify .",
    "translated_text": "Paleontologists have described a mechanism that leads to the formation of dinosaur mummies under non-exceptional conditions. After comparing the paleontological data with forensic research, scientists concluded that the dinosaur's body skin must first be damaged by large scales, which then release gases, liquids, and microorganisms, leaving the skin intact and dry. This means that dinosaur mummies may not be as rare as previously thought, the authors of the study write in PLoS ONE. The term \"mummy\" in paleontology refers to the fossils that have preserved the skin well, and sometimes other soft tissues. According to the common view, mummies arise if two taphonomic conditions are met. First, the body needs to dry out. It requires a long stay in the air. The burial must be fast enough so that the fallen person does not damage the corpse within hours of death. These conditions seem to be mutually exclusive, suggesting the uniqueness and exclusivity of dinosaur mummies. Paleontologists under the direction of Stephanie K. Drumheller (born Stephanie K. DrumhellerI) from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville found that mummies may be much more common than is commonly believed. By combining the results of an edmontosaur mummy analysis with modern knowledge of the decay process, scientists have proposed a new explanation for how such specimens can emerge. During the study, the authors of the study studied the fossils of edmontosaurus sp. The fossils are in the State Mining Collection in Bismarck, North Dakota, under the care of the North Dakota Geological Survey. The dry skin on the dinosaur's bones looks swollen, which is particularly evident in the finger parts of the limbs. Computed tomography showed that the bones of the fingers on the right frontal limb were not deformed, which led the authors to conclude that the skin did not swell as a result of taphonomic compression while the remains were lying in the ground. Despite the remarkable preservation of the skin and the fact that some structures in it and the bones are virtually intact, scientists have not found any trace of other tissue on the scans. Also, paleontologists have not observed any visible signs of internal organs during the mechanical preparation of the sample for study. The results of the study suggest that Edmontosaurus' skin was \"bloated\", not compressed. It's interesting that the mummies of Edmontosaurus were found near the fossil of a crocodile. Scientists speculated that the crocodile swallowed the remains of the dinosaur and then died in a flash flood. However, careful study of the debris covering the remains did not confirm this hypothesis: according to the site analysis, where the edmontosaurus was found, the animal lived in a warm and humid environment, died near the reservoir and was gradually buried with increasing debris. The remains of the crocodile were probably found near Edmontosaurus by chance and only indicate that these animals lived in similar conditions. To understand how the dinosaur mummy did emerge in conditions deemed unsuitable for its formation, scientists turned to modern forensic literature, which describes similar cases of postmortem changes. Mummification of mammals does not necessarily require dry conditions. It can also occur in relatively wet environments when the remains have survived incomplete decomposition. Most skin-dissolving individuals prefer more nutritious muscles and guts. And if large animals can accidentally bite off a large amount of skin trying to reach the tissue underneath, then small saurophaguses create holes in the body cavities, gaining access to the interior. The researchers suggested that the damage to the dinosaur's skin exposed the insides and allowed a similar process to occur. Scientists believe that the varying nature of the damage found on Edmontosaurus' skin and bones suggests that the dead body was covered by various types of fallen ones. The holes and traces on the shoulder and radial bones, as well as the grooves in the soft tissues of the forearm, were the result of bites, and the tail damage was no longer caused by teeth, but by flexible claws. Such traces are typical of medium and large carnivores  for example, for young individuals of the tyrannosaurus rex (Tyrannosaurus rex), which also lived in this ecosystem. Thus, skin damage provided a pathway for the release of gases, liquids, and microorganisms associated with decomposition. This kept the skin from rotting for weeks or months to dry. Later, the dried remains were deposited. The authors called this process \"drying and deflation\". He explains why rocky skin, although rare, is not an exceptional rarity in dinosaur fossils and does not suggest that deposition is the result of rapid burial. The researchers also stressed that this is not the only way that a mummy can be formed, but that applying the rich experience of modern forensic research to paleontological issues opens up new avenues for research. This is not the first time that modern medicine has been used in paleontological research. We've written before that how modern methods of analysis and comparison to the bone of a human suffering from osteogenic sarcoma have allowed cancer to be diagnosed for the first time in a dinosaur that lived more than 70 million years ago."

    "translated_title": "Elephants need a lot of neurons to control their jaws and ears.",
    "translated_text": "German researchers found that the facial nerve of elephants contains an exceptionally large number of neurons compared to many other mammals  on average from 54,000 to 63,000, depending on the species. The authors associate this with the control of the hubot and the ears. The results of the study of four savannah elephants and four Asian elephants are published in Science Advances. Modern research methods have made it possible to better understand the structure of humans and animals. Last year, scientists from 13 laboratories were able to create a neuron atlas of the primary motor crust of mammals based on data from humans, marmosets, and mice, and earlier, a team of Japanese neuroscientists were able to locate the taste crust of humans. Despite the vast amount of research that scientists have done to uncover the structure and function of the brains of various animals, much remains unknown. The elephant brain remained one of those mysteries because of the difficulty of extracting samples for research. Now zoologists and neuroscientists from Germany under the leadership of Lena Kaufman (Lena V. Kaufmann) at Humboldt University in Berlin have amassed enough material to finally study the brains of the savannas (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on four individuals of each species. They focused on the neurons of the facial nerve core that control facial muscles. To count neurons in the facial nerve core of elephants, the authors used two methods: optical fractionation and counting all neurons in every tenth medium. Both methods showed similar results: an average of 62,961-63,202 neurons in a savannah elephant and 52,146-54,103 in an Asian elephant. The authors then tested whether the large number of facial neurons were actually linked to elephant brains weighing only 4.7 kilograms. For this, they did an allometric analysis that shows the relationship between two quantities (in this case, between the number of neurons in the facial nerve nucleus) in the form of a degree-law equation. This allows for a symmetry of scale, which is important when comparing different sized mammals. Using this method, the authors constructed a logarithmic graph that compared the number of facial neurons in elephants and other mammals. The elephant had multiple neurons than expected in primates on the translated scale, and the difference was three 95 percent confidence intervals. The next stage was the comparison of the subnucleus, which is responsible for the movement of facial muscles, two species of elephants and other mammals. The authors suggested that the dorsal and lateral subclavian in elephants may be responsible for the dorsal and ventral hobot muscles for several reasons, including the topography of the core regions responsible for the different facial muscles in mammals, as well as the large size and elongated shape of the dorsal and lateral subclavian. Their assumptions were confirmed by comparing the number of axons in the branches of the facial nerve and the corresponding subnuclear. And the question was also why savannah elephants had more facial neurons than Asian elephants. One of the reasons is the size of the ears. The large ears of savannas require about 1,1965 neurons, while Asian elephants require 7,498 neurons. In addition, the habitat of savannah elephants has two ridges, which allows elephants to capture their objects, and Asian elephants do not have such ridges, so they can only capture an object by completely capturing its ridge. We've been talking about how the International Union for Conservation of Nature last year divided African elephants into savannah and forest, and how the elephants were counted by a neural network using satellite imagery."

    "translated_title": "A failed attempt to exterminate mice on Goff Island still benefited the seabirds",
    "translated_text": "Attempts to clear Goff Island in the South Atlantic of invasive mice that attack seabirds have failed: some rodents have survived and have begun to quickly re-establish numbers. However, while the island is still small, mice do not hunt local birds, which allowed the birds to spawn peacefully for the first time in many years. For example, for the first time in this century, more than a thousand young have been operated on in rare Tristan albatross. As noted on the website of the Goff Mouse Project, this year ornithologists saw what an island without rodents would look like and this added to their determination to complete the work. House mice (Mus musculus) together with grey mice (Rattus norvegicus), black mice (R. Rattus) and small (R. Exulans) are among the most dangerous invasive species. Thanks to humans, these rodents have inhabited many oceanic islands and have become active devourers of the local fauna, which has evolved over millions of years in the absence of land mammals and therefore could not protect itself from voracious invaders. Many island species of birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates have become very rare or extinct due to the importation of mice and rats. Goff Island, located in the southern Atlantic, is a fine example of the damage invasive rodents can do to the environment. Gofa is home to one of the world's largest colonies of seabirds. Every year, tens of millions of albatross, raccoons, penguins, and other seabirds breed their young here. Some of them, such as the Tristan albatross (Diomedea dabbenena), the Atlantic typhoon (Pterodroma incerta) and the Macgillivray prion (Pachyptila (salvini) macgillivray) nest almost exclusively on this island. In the 19th century, people accidentally brought house mice to Goff, which became very numerous and increased in size. In recent decades, a huge population of rodents has lost access to normal food, such as seeds and invertebrates, so they have begun hunting seabirds. At first, mice learned to steal eggs and eat helpless young alive, and a few years ago, ornithologists recorded their attacks on adult birds, including the feeding of albatross. As a result, the colony lost up to two million eggs and chicks each year. Ornithologists were seriously concerned that the Tristan albatross and some other rare species would be completely extinct because of predatory mice. To help the feathered inhabitants of Gofa survive, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds decided to completely clear the island of introduced rodents. This is a difficult task, especially given the difficulty of reaching the island and the complex terrain. Last summer, after years of planning and relocation, the specialists finally headed to Goff and scattered poisoned bait throughout the area. It was supposed to kill the entire local mouse population. At first, it seemed like the operation was successful. The number of mice decreased before it was completed, allowing the Tristan albatross to breed its young for the first time in many years. In some areas, the success rate of breeding these birds has exceeded 70 percent, which is much better than the average of previous years (though it has grown slightly throughout the island as a whole). However, getting rid of invasive rodents was harder than ornithologists would like. The poisoned bait was discarded in August, and in December a mouse was spotted in Gofa, surviving the extermination of its relatives. During a search conducted in early 2022, researchers found that the few remaining mice on the island are rapidly recovering. However, while the total number of mice was not eliminated, they were still much smaller than before. With such a low population, rodents do not compete with each other for their usual food and therefore do not hunt seabirds. As a result, the Goff feathers received a long-awaited respite and produced much more offspring than usual. For example, if in the past, due to constant mouse attacks, the average success rate of MacGilliver's prions was only six percent, and in some years it dropped to zero, this year it has reached 82 percent. Among Atlantic stormy beetles, this year's offspring successfully produced 63 percent of the pairs  twice as many as a year earlier and much more than the average of previous years, and among brown stormy beetles (Procellaria cinerea)  75 percent of the pairs compared to 30 percent last year. Finally, the success rate of breeding Tristan albatross increased from 32 percent to 76 percent. For the first time in this century, they've managed to raise more than a thousand chicks. It is believed to be a threshold that is necessary to maintain the population of this species. Overall, the breeding season for the Goff seabirds has been very successful. No sign of mice attacking eggs, chicks, or adult individuals has been found. Unfortunately, this situation is unlikely to last long. In a few years, the number of mice will inevitably grow again to the point where they will no longer catch plants, seeds and invertebrates and will hunt birds. As long as there are at least a few mice left on the island, the local birds will not feel safe. Ornithologists say this year has shown what Goff would be like without mice. This adds to their determination to complete the project and completely clear the island of invasive rodents. We've been talking about how the Australians killed about 350,000 rats and mice on Lord Howe Island. This has benefited rare species, such as the endemic cockroach Panesthia lata, a small population that has managed to survive in the hard-to-reach areas of the north of the island."

    "translated_title": "Israeli chickens were taught to bear only female offspring",
    "translated_text": "Israeli scientists have developed a line of genetically modified chickens that only produce females, reports BBC. To achieve this, several new genes were inserted into one of the chicken's sex chromosomes. Their blue light products trigger an apoptosis program in the cells. So if you light blue rays on the embryos, only the bearers of this chromosome -- that is, the males -- die. Only female offspring are produced, and this can be used in production, where chickens are still more in demand, and newly hatched chickens have to be killed. Farmers, breeders, and experimental biologists would have a much easier life if they had the opportunity to choose the sex offspring from the animals they breed. It is usually necessary to wait for the cubs to grow up to determine their sex and select those needed for research or production. Females are most often picked up on farms because they lay eggs or give milk. Male animals, which are not so much needed, are most often killed to avoid wasting their resources. In particular, on poultry farms, young chickens are killed almost immediately after hatching. Israeli embryologist Yuval Cinnamon of the Volcanic Institute and his colleagues founded Huminn Poultry, and now told the BBC that they have a solution to this problem for breeding chickens. Researchers have developed a genetic design that can be inserted into the sex chromosomes of birds so that only females are selected from the offspring at the earliest stages of embryonic development. The sex-determination system in birds is different from that in mammals. They have a homogametic (i.e., carrying two identical sex chromosomes) sex  male, corresponding to the ZZ genotype. And the female sex is heterogametic: it's determined by two different chromosomes, WZ. So the scientists suggested the following scheme. The genetic design that scientists invented is sensitive to blue light. With the help of CRISPR/Cas9 molecular scissors, it is embedded in the Z-chromosome of females  to produce chickens with the WZ genotype*. They're then crossed with the normal ZZ males. The outlet produces embryos of two types: WZ (female) and ZZ* (male). If the blue rays are lit on them for hours, the male embryos die and only the chickens remain. His research has not yet been published anywhere  so it is impossible to test the effectiveness of this method or to understand exactly how it works. But in 2020, Cinnamon already patented a similar technology in Europe, and it's assumed that the principle of its device has remained the same. According to this patent, the genetic tape is arranged as follows. It contains the genes of two proteins: Cry-2 and CIBN. These proteins are light-sensitive: normally they exist separately, but when they catch blue rays, they change their shape and bind together to form dimers. To each of these proteins, the researchers attached a single subunit of the Cre enzyme. So while the proteins are in the vacuum, the subunits don't work, but once the proteins fuse, two halves of Cre meet and form a full-fledged enzyme. In addition to the genes of these two proteins with half Cre sewn together, the tape has a stop sequence that blocks further reading of information. And behind the stop sequence is some kind of \"lethal gene\". The researchers don't specify which, but they do offer several options, and all of them are signaling proteins that can trigger a program of cell death, which is apoptosis. When the full Cre enzyme is collected in the cell, it binds to the edges of the stop sequence and cuts it off the tape. Now nothing stops the reading of the lethal gene and the cell dies of apoptosis. In an interview with BBC, Tsinnamon notes that such a genetic design should be as safe as possible. Females born to genetically modified chickens do not carry an edited Z chromosome  it is only needed to kill male embryos in the early stages. So the output should be the same as the normal chickens, with no trace of genetic interference. The developers told the BBC that they are working with chicken producers and are working on the process. When they plan to get a license and tell us more about their technology, yet unknown. We've already talked about how other Israeli researchers learned to regulate the sex offspring in mice using similar technology. They also altered the sex chromosomes of animals, but this time, the CRISPR/Cas9 system had to collect two halves and remove the \"lethal gene\" from the genome. And then Japanese scientists came up with an even simpler method -- they just learned to slow down the X-chromosome-bearing sperm."

    "translated_text": "Bulgarian archaeologists discovered the ruins of the temple during excavations of the ancient city of Perperikon. They found fragments of walls, some of which reached nearly three meters in height, and an altar for making sacrifices. According to scholars, this pagan shrine functioned until the spread of Christianity in the early 5th century. This is reported by the Bulgarian national radio. In the Eastern Rhodopes, about 20 kilometers from the Bulgarian city of Kirjali, are the ruins of Perperikon. Excavations of this ancient city, built on a 470-meter-high rocky hill, have been going on for more than 20 years. It seems that the site gained its religious significance in the 4th millennium BC, which archaeologists associate with the worship of the Sun. However, the main finds from this monument date back to later times: the 2nd millennium BC  1st millennium AD. Archaeological excavations have revealed the acropolis, a fortified wall built in the second half of the 3rd century BC, when these lands were under Roman rule. But more attention is drawn to dozens of buildings cut into the rocks. The most famous of these is the palace-sanctuary, where a large altar was discovered in 2004. Bulgarian scientists have proposed that the temple found is the ancient author's sanctuary of Dionysus. After the spread of Christianity in the region, Perpericon continued to be a major religious center, as indicated by the remains of the temple and mausoleum-rotonids. Bulgarian archaeologists have reported a new discovery made during excavations of the ancient city of Perperikon. Thus, just ten meters from the famous hall with a large altar (a supposed sanctuary of the god Dionysus) scientists discovered the ruins of another temple. According to Nikolay Ovcharov, an archaeologist at the National Archaeological Institute and Museum in Sofia, who heads the Perperikon excavations, some parts of the walls of the temple are nearly three metres high. This makes the find one of the best preserved buildings in the ancient city. Researchers excavated the eastern part of the monumental structure and discovered an altar. According to archaeologists, the site dates back to pagan times and to the Christian era. In earlier times, sacrifices were even made here, as evidenced by the shape of an altar with a hole for the blood of slain animals to drain. After the conversion to Christianity in the early 5th century, this pagan sanctuary, like other temples, was filled with earth and turned into a warehouse for storing clay vessels with grain. According to Ovcharov, the excavation of the temple will probably not be completed in the near future due to insufficient funding. Recently, N+1 was talking about other ancient temples discovered by archaeologists. In Iran, scientists have found the ruins of the third largest Zoroastrian fire temple. In Egypt, the remains of a temple to the goddess Isis, dating back to the Hellenistic era, were discovered. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "A drone attached to the human body will help increase the realism of virtual reality",
    "translated_text": "Engineers from Germany and Canada have developed a technology that will help improve the imitation of the sensations of user interaction with objects in virtual reality. It is a quadcopter that flies near the user and impacts through a thread attached to a ring with a moving element on the user's body, mimicking a physical response to interaction with a virtual object. The developers hope that this way of mimicking interaction will help to increase the realism of virtual reality experiences and also help rehabilitate patients when exercising. The article on the development was published in the collection of materials of the UIST 22 conference. The effect of virtual reality presence is achieved not only by high image quality in VR helmets, but also by technologies that mimic the physical interaction of the user with virtual objects. For example, American engineers have proposed using ultrasonic emitters built into VR glasses to mimic the user's wind and rain sensations on the face, and researchers at the Toyohashi Institute of Technology in Japan have developed a device that mimics the sensations of walking by vibration. However, many such devices have limited functionality and are able to mimic the physical impact of only one type in a limited range of directions and only on certain parts of the user's body. Engineers led by Martin Feick of the University of Saar, Germany, have proposed using flying drones to simulate the sensations of physical interaction with objects inside virtual reality. To do this, the drone is connected to the human body by means of a pull made of polyamide or nylon thread. One end of the thread is attached to a hook on a moving ring located above another stationary plastic ring. It is attached directly to the body and can be worn, for example, on the user's fingers, ankles or wrists. Thus, the mobility of the attachment point, which can be rotated after the drone is flying around the user, can also change the direction of the force applied. Besides, there could be several drones. The behavior of drones in the air and their trajectory of movement changes depending on events taking place in virtual reality. They move in sync with the user's body, avoiding any strings and avoiding collisions with it and with each other until the force is applied in a given direction to simulate the response to some action in virtual reality. For example, in a scenario where a user hits a virtual ball with his foot, the drone attached to the elbow pulls the string sharply in the opposite direction, mimicking the feedback that the user should experience when interacting with the object. If the user presses a virtual button with his index finger, the drone connected to the index finger starts moving upwards, creating a thread tension that mimics the force with which the button spring would affect the user's finger. The same approach can be used to simulate interactions with other people in a virtual space, for example, when learning new skills with a remote trainer. For the tests, the engineers built a small quadcopter measuring 95 millimeters and weighing 72 grams. The positioning system in space consists of 13 cameras fixed to a stationary aluminum frame. It tracks the location of the drone by the tags on it in the area of 5×5×2.5 meters. The threads are made of plastic using 3D printing and are made of two elements: a stationary base that is adjacent to the user's body, and a mobile ring with a thread attachment that slides over the base. According to the engineers, in addition to their virtual reality applications, their system, called HapticPuppet, can be used in rehabilitation programs for patients performing physical exercises. But they still have a lot of issues to deal with when they're going to implement this technology, like developing algorithms that allow them to use more than one quadcopter at a time so they don't collide in the air and get caught up in the traction. The desire to enhance the realism of virtual reality can take quite unusual and extreme forms. For example, Oculus co-founder Palmer Lackey created a VR helmet that can kill its user in real life. For this purpose, the device has three pyro-patrons that activate if a player dies in the virtual world."

    "translated_title": "Peasant meat for Anglo-Saxon kings went to mass feasts",
    "translated_text": "British scientists found no evidence that the elite of early medieval England in the 5th-8th centuries consumed as much meat as previously thought. To do this, they studied the results of analyses of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the bone collagen of 2023 people. At the same time, they discovered that written accounts of peasant taxes in the form of large quantities of meat, poultry, and fish had apparently been misinterpreted earlier. According to the scientists, these foods were not intended to provide the daily diet of rulers, but for mass feasts, in which several hundred people could participate. This is reported in two articles published in the Anglo-Saxon magazine England (1, 2). In the early 5th century CE, the Romans left Britain, after which most of it was conquered by the Germanic tribes of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. The social basis of Anglo-Saxon society was the free peasants (kerls), who carried on their household on land plots, recognizing only the king as lord. However, they were responsible for a number of duties, such as maintaining bridges, serving in the militia called by the king, or paying a food rental to their ruler. It was only after the Viking's devastating campaigns, when the state had to levy more and more taxes, that categories of dependent peasants emerged that were under the protection of the Anglo-Saxon nobility. It was believed that the Anglo-Saxon society had a very different diet for the common people and the elite. This hypothesis was based on the idea of a food rental that the peasants paid to the king. The latter, along with his household, regularly traveled around his lands and received a certain set of food. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon code of customary law \"Pravde Iné\", probably drawn up at the end of the 7th century, stated that from ten gaids (the unit of land area) one had to pay, in particular, 10 chons of honey, 300 loaves of bread, about 12 bushels of elk, 2 adult cows, 10 goats, 20 hens, 10 cheeses, 5 salmon and 100 eggs. This, many scientists believe, indicated that the diet of kings and their families was rich in animal protein. Sam Leggett of the University of Edinburgh and Tom Lambert of Cambridge University decided to test the long-held assumption about the diet of the elite in early medieval England, which was that the diets of high social status people, especially men, consisted largely of meat. This view was based on the interpretation of the written sources of the 7th to 10th centuries related to food rental. After assessing the weight, volume, and calorie content of these foods, the study authors concluded that they were not intended for daily consumption, but for large feasts attended by several hundred guests. Previous studies have shown that Britain began to consume more sheep, cattle, and pigs in the Roman period. However, after the fall of the empire, paleontologists estimate that animals were bred primarily for dairy, fur, or used as draft cattle. As the country became Christian, people began to eat more chicken and fish. At the same time, researchers have found evidence of mass feasts, such as the VVII-century pits in Suffolk, where the whole of the tusks of cattle were roasted. Paleobotany also indicates that in England during the early Middle Ages there were changes in agriculture related to the relationship between crops grown and agricultural land treatment technologies. In a new study, the authors presented the results of a stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis, which they used to determine the relationship between diet, social status and funeral rites. In total, they collected data on 2023 people living in England during the Roman  Anglo-Norman period. They focused their attention primarily on 1,463 adult individuals of the 5th-8th centuries, a time when burial equipment provided information about the social status of the dead. As a result of the study, scientists did not find a link between animal protein-rich diet and social upper class in people living in the VVIII centuries. The data showed that most individuals regardless of their social status consumed animal protein in some form or another on a daily basis. However, the amount of food consumed was roughly the same as what ovulactovegetarians consumed, which means that people ate not only plant foods but also milk and eggs. Scientists have concluded that people's diet is largely dependent on the region and the seasons. Perhaps the elite diet differed more in consuming higher quality products, fruits, which cannot be detected by analyzing stable isotopes. Previously, N+1 was talking about other studies on early medieval England. British archaeologists have examined the Anchor Church Caves and found that they were used as a cell, as well as a large Anglo-Saxon cemetery dating back to the 5th-6th century.

    "translated_title": "The glowing fire added dynamics to the Paleolithic engravings",
    "translated_text": "British archaeologists have examined engraved tablets of Madeleine culture, many of which contained traces of heat. Using experimental and computer modeling, scientists have discovered that ancient artists probably created images on limestone tablets near the glittering light of fire. This added dynamics to the engraved figures, and may also explain why the artifacts were exposed to high temperatures. This is reported in an article published in the journal PLoS One. In the late Paleolithic era, about 18/1711,5 thousand years ago, there was a Madlen archaeological culture in Western and Central Europe, named after the French cave of La Madlen. The area of this culture encompassed modern-day Spain, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany. It's a time when conditions on the continent were very harsh. Madeleine culture was a hunt for mammoth fauna, and after its extinction, for northern deer, wild horses and other large animals. Archaeologists believe that the Madeleines lived in earthen dwellings similar to the chomi, and used the caves as sanctuaries. From the Madelyn culture to the present day, magnificent cave art monuments have survived, including the rock paintings in the famous Lasco and Altamira caves, where realistic and colorful images of animals  bison, horses and deer are found. In addition, the Madeleines made large figures of humans and animals from bones, made clay sculptures, for example, in the Tuck-dOduber sanctuary, where archaeologists discovered two carved bison. The Madelyn culture is also characterized by portable art objects, such as engraved stone tablets. Andy Needham of York University, together with his British colleagues, studied 50 engravings discovered in the mid-19th century in southern France during excavations of the Montastryck rock. A radiocarbon analysis conducted in 1969 showed that these artifacts were created about 1598013579 years ago (calibrated dating). The objects included in the study were engraved tablets of Madelyn culture, made of limestone. On many of these engravings, scientists have found evidence that these objects were heating up. This was manifested, for example, in characteristic changes in the breed, accompanied by the appearance of pink color (the so-called rubefaction). To find out why these artifacts were heating up, scientists used a complex of techniques, including microscopy, 3-D modeling, and experimental archaeology. The experiment showed that engravings without visible traces of heating could still be exposed to high temperatures of no more than 100 to 300 degrees Celsius. As might be expected, the location of the heat trail and the color change depended on the proximity of the sign to the source of the fire. At the same time, scientists noticed that when they placed experimental plates near the fire, they had noticeable visual effects. The falling light, for example, seemed to emphasize the connection between the morphological features of the limestone tile and the engraved images. Also, the flashing light added dynamics to the images, creating the effect of moving figures. The researchers stressed that the results they obtained cannot completely rule out the possibility that heating traces on the engravings appeared as a result of other processes. However, they tend to think that it was because they were deliberately placed near the source of the fire. Previously, N+1 was talking about other studies on Paleolithic art. For example, archaeologists have clarified the time of the creation of the underground sanctuary in the Ignacio Cave, and have also found that Chinese rock paintings were left by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers.

    "translated_title": "The tunnel effect helped lead to radical chemical reactions.",
    "translated_text": "Chemists have learned to conduct radical reactions without the use of toxic reagents based on lead and silicon. They did this because of the tunneling effect, which allowed a radical reaction to travel at high speed with a large kinetic barrier. The study was published by Science. Reactions in organic chemistry are often divided into classes, depending on which unstable particles form during the reaction  anions, cationes or radicals. In radical reactions, particles are formed in which one or more atoms have unbroken electrons. Such particles are often unstable and easily react, for example, with halogen-organic compounds, by separating the halogen atom from the carbon atom. They can also enter a cyclic reaction with double and triple carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroate bonds. Usually, chemists use lead or silicon-based toxic compounds to conduct radical reactions, which easily form radials  particles with unbroken electrons. And if these methods are good for organic chemistry research, they're not good for medical chemistry. Substances have to be cleaned up after the reaction. So scientists are looking for ways to generate reactive radicals from organic molecules that do not contain lead or silicon. One such method was found by Timothy Constantin of the University of Manchester and his colleagues from Britain, Germany, Spain, and France. They studied reactions in which a radical, usually tributhylstanil •SnBu3 or trimethylsilic •SiMe3, separates the halogen atom or group of atoms from the carbon atom. And in the process of computer modeling these reactions, scientists found that instead of lead or silicon-based radicals, they could use the simplest hydrogen-based radical •H (which is basically a free hydrogen atom). To generate this radical, chemists have decided to make gamma-terpine, a component of natural essential oils. In this compound, two double bonds are located in a six-member carbon cycle, and only one double bond is missing to form a stable aromatic system. Therefore, the authors of the paper suggested that gamma-terpene in the lighting conditions with a photocatalyst would form a radical capable of regrouping with the emission of the H-radical, which would participate in the degallogenation reaction. To test their hypothesis, chemists took a bromine-replaced piperidine, mixed it with gamma-terpine, a photocatalyst, sodium chloride, and irradiated the reaction mixture with blue light. At the end of the reaction, they were able to identify a product of degallogenation with a quantitative output. Other iodine, chlorine, and bromide reactors were also doing well. Asides under similar conditions were converted into amines, and compounds with multiple bonds, as they were supposed to, entered into radical cyclization reactions. Then the scientists decided to explore the mechanism of open reaction. They took cyclohexadiene, which was a simpler replacement for gamma-terpene, and mixed it with different halogen organic compounds. Then the chemists measured the reaction rate of the decay of the radical formed from cyclohexadiene. It turns out that unlike similar experiments with silicon radicals, the velocity constant was not dependent on either the type of substrate or the reaction temperature. Surprised by these results, the chemists conducted a computer simulation of the process. It showed that the formation of the \"naked\" H-radical was energy-deprived, and as the chemists had suggested, the reaction could not proceed. On the other hand, the most energy-efficient was a synchronous process in which the formation of a radical and the dehalogenation occur simultaneously. But there was also a problem with it -- because of the high kinetic barrier of 15 kilokalori per mole, this reaction would be very slow, which was not consistent with the experiment. Then chemists suggested that the barrier helps to overcome the tunnel effect of the  radical. This assumption was confirmed by measuring the kinetic isotope effect. It showed that if you use deteriorated cyclohexacadian to react, the reaction is 20 times worse. And this slowdown is typically characteristic of reactions that involve tunneling through a much harder barrier. As a result, the researchers developed a convenient way to conduct radical reactions without the use of toxic reagents and discovered the mechanism of open reaction. They believe their work will allow them to find new chemical reactions that can go through quantum effects. Tunneling allows for more than just radical reactions. For example, we've already mentioned that the mechanism of some totomisation reactions also involves tunneling hydrogen. Michael Boim"

    "translated_title": "Modeled plankton surfed at turbulence and doubled its speed .",
    "translated_text": "Physicists and biologists from France and the United States have modeled the movement of plankton, which uses water vortices to move faster, climbing them like surfboards on waves. To do this, they derived an equation of motion for a plankton that measures the local gradient of flow and changes its direction to float upwards faster, and then studied its behavior in turbulent conditions. The strategy was one and a half times more effective than previous studies, and the average vertical velocity of the plankton was twice its own, scientists write in Physical Review Letters. Plankton is a group of aquatic organisms that, due to their small size (from tens of micrometers to several centimeters) and low velocity, are unable to resist currents and drift freely in the ocean. Despite this, many plankton species have movement organs and can travel long distances during daytime vertical migrations (so, side-boats can go up and down 150 metres in a day). According to scientists, the animals migrate to hide from predators at the bottom of the pond during the day, and to feed on the surface at night, and the latter, if they have movement organs,  on the contrary, are at the surface during the day and go to the bottom at night. In this way, the plankton uses light- and gravity-sensitive organelles to determine its vertical direction. In the context of migration, scientists are particularly interested in the ability of some plankton species to estimate the gradient of water velocity using jellyfish. The fact is that even in standing water bodies, water is continuously mixed with turbulent flows that are caused by friction from winds and tides, as well as by the temperature stratification of the water bodies. Scientists suggest that plankton can use these turbulences to swim at the right moment along their flow to migrate faster. And while there is no experimental evidence of this behavior, theorists have long used machine learning to create models in which a plankton, knowing only the local gradient of water speed and direction to the target, tries to navigate through turbulent currents as quickly as possible. In such studies, the trained plankton was faster than the one that swam only in the direction of the target. However, his behavior remained unoptimal even though the learning took place in simplified conditions, namely in uniform continuous flows. Another disadvantage of the method is that the behavioral strategies it produces are difficult to interpret. In this regard, a group of French and American scientists led by Remi Monthiller of the University of Ex-Marseille applied a different  analytical approach to the problem of vertical migrations of plankton in turbulent flows. First, the researchers recorded the equation of the plankter's movement  units of plankton  in the outer water flow, and then maximized its displacement along the vertical axis at a fixed time. As a result, scientists have developed an expression for the direction of motion that the plankter must choose based on the local water velocity gradient to move upwards faster. To assess the effectiveness of the strategy, which the authors called surfing, they tested it in a numerical model of a three-dimensional turbulent flow with Reynolds number equal to 418. Also, by using modeling, scientists have determined the optimal value of the free parameter of the  time interval theory, at which the plankter measures the gradient of water velocity. It also turned out to be a function of the local gradient of flow rate. During the numerical experiment, the surfers systematically surpassed the average speed of a plankton, which did not change direction and floated only upwards. And if the first ones, using the vertical component of the speed of the whirlwinds, accelerated almost twice as fast, the second ones moved at an average speed equal to their own, because turbulence in their case acted like noise with an average of zero. Scientists estimate that such surfers are 1.5 times more effective than plankters trained in a previous study. For specific purposes, scientists have calculated the rotation times of three plankton species: copepods, dinoflagellates, and spineless lizards. The most efficient of the dinosaur surfers  their average speed was twice their own (0.3 millimeters per second), while the larvae and copepods accelerated at turbulencies almost one and a half times (their own speed of 2 and 3 millimeters per second respectively). The authors note that although the study used a uniform and isotropic turbulent flow with a fixed Reynolds number, the surfing strategy is adaptable to turbulences of varying intensities and resistant to fluctuations. They also studied the effect of sound on the senses and movement of plankton on strategy effectiveness: it was found to remain unchanged at up to 25 percent of the time. Mathematical models have long helped scientists understand the behavior of living organisms. For example, American scientists modeled the swimming motion of the nematodes and found that the distinctive feature of their motion in three dimensions was the harmonic oscillations with periodic sharp turns relative to their axis. In another study, scientists developed a model that could study the migration of migratory birds by taking into account the wind. Elizabeth of the Church"

    "translated_title": "James Webb has found his first candidate for the cold brown dwarf.",
    "translated_text": "The James Webb infrared space telescope has discovered a candidate for cold brown dwarfs, which is the first such object to be discovered for him. The object is in a thick disk or galaxy of the Milky Way, and its nature should be confirmed by further observations. The print of the work is published on the arXiv website. The first is the Internet. Brown dwarfs occupy an intermediate position between giant planets and dwarf stars. They are massive enough to have a fusion reaction involving deuterium or even lithium under their surface, but their mass is still insufficient to initiate a fusion reaction involving hydrogen. A significant part of the Milky Way's nearby objects are brown dwarfs with masses less than 0.07 times the Sun's mass and effective temperatures less than 2,000 kelvins. These objects are very faint and emit mostly in the infrared range. The wide-angle views of the sky in search of brown dwarfs are limited to the nearest neighborhoods of the Sun (less than a hundred parsecs). The Hubble's deeper but less extensive observations have allowed for the detection of similar objects at great distances, but they are limited by wavelengths of less than two micrometers, which prevents us from looking for the coldest brown dwarfs. This is expected to be the result of a new space observatory that recently launched a scientific program. A team of astronomers led by Mario Nonino of the Trieste Astronomical Observatory reported the discovery of a candidate for the cold brown dwarf GLASS-JWST-BD1, which became the first such object for James Webb. The discovery was made by chance during the GLASS-JWST observation program, in which NIRCam, NIRSPEC and NIRISS instruments conducted near-infrared observations of the massive Abell 2744 galaxy cluster using 7 broadband filters. The distance from the Sun to the object found is 570 to 720 parsecs, and the best model suitable for these observations is a brown dwarf of spectral type T8T9, with an effective temperature of just 600 kelvins, a mass of about 0.03 solar masses and an age of 5 billion years. The dwarf is in a thick disk or gala of the Milky Way. Scientists reject the possibility that GLASS-JWST-BD1 is a red background star or quasar or galaxy with a very large redshift, but emphasize that further observations are needed to definitively confirm the discovery. The results of the observations confirm James Webb's ability to explore very small-mass substellar objects in the disk and galaxy. We've been talking about how James Webb considered a candidate for a record-breaking star and how a choriza image was given for a Proxima Centauri image taken by the observatory. Alexander Voytyk"

    "translated_title": "Gravitational constant measured with the help of bending oscillations of metallic beams",
    "translated_text": "Swiss physicists experimentally implemented a new way of measuring gravitational constant. They measured the amplitude of the bending oscillation of the receiver beam suspended adjacent to the transmitter beam. The vibrations of the transmitter created a variable gravitational force that made the receiver vibrate. Despite the large errors, the method could potentially be more accurate than its alternatives, thanks to higher operating frequencies. The study was published in Nature Physics. Gravity is the weakest of the four known fundamental interactions. It's like an electromagnetic, long-range. This puts him in a unique position in relation to the ordinary human experience. Indeed, the gravity of the Earth  of a massive astronomical object  plays an important role in shaping the conditions for our physical existence, but the attraction between the objects around us is negligible compared to the attraction caused by electromagnetism, such as magnetization or gluing. This weakness is the main reason why the accuracy of measuring the gravitational constant, the gravitational interaction constant, is five orders of magnitude less than the accuracy that physicists know of its electromagnetic analog, the constant thin structure. The current relative uncertainty, calculated by tens of millions of parts, is obtained through fluctuating experiments where gravity is opposed by some other force (usually elasticity). The low power causes extremely low vibration frequencies (milligers), which are increasingly affected by noise. This seems to be one of the reasons why there is a large spread (over 500 million shares) between the results of experiments in different laboratories. These inconsistencies are commonly explained by unrecognised systemic errors. So physicists around the world are trying to repeat the measurements of this constant in as many different ways as possible. This is the background of the work of Tobias Brack and his colleagues at the Swiss Technical University of Zurich. Their work was a re-imagining of an experiment conducted in 1997 by their school colleague William Walker. This physicist proposed to determine the gravitational constant in an experiment with two perfect parallel massive beams, one of which vibrates with resonance frequency, thus creating a variable gravitational field and swinging the second beam. The scientist was able to record the second beam of oscillation, but due to poor temperature stabilization and the limitations of electronics, optics, and mechanics available at the time, the measurement accuracy was too poor, and the method was deemed ineffective. Now, the arsenal of physicists has been upgraded enough to bring this method to an acceptable level of measurement. The boxed transmitter in their experience was made of tungsten and had dimensions of 1000×20×10 millimeters. A piezoelectric converter with counterweight was attached to the center, which triggered the bending of the beam's lowest frequency, equal to 42.65 Hertz. The same frequency was used in a beam receiver made of titanium with a 17×8.5 millimeter cross section. Her important characteristic was a high kindness of over 35,000. Both beams were suspended from the points where the bending knots come in. In both cases, physicists measured the amplitude of the oscillation using lasers, but for the detector, they did it for three points simultaneously in synchronous amplification. A key feature of the scientists' work was the noise protection system. To combat the acoustic interaction channel, they placed both beams in aluminum vacuum chambers. The camera for the receiver was located on an anti-vibration table, and the camera for the transmitter was suspended on springs to a moving switch with a high degree of amortisation. The entire laboratory was located deep beneath the Swiss Alps, which provided temperature stability (a dispersion of two thousand degrees per half hour or 13 thousand degrees per day of measurement), as well as seismic protection. By changing the frequency of the piezoelectric converter in small steps, the authors found that the resonance in the receiver bulk was triggered at a frequency of 42,65105015 ((77). Later, they constructed a dependence of the coefficient of transmission of oscillation at the resonant frequency from the distance. Comparing the resulting curve to the analytical and numerical dependencies showed that it is described with good accuracy by Newton's gravity. The formula's preparation allowed us to extract several parameters from the experiment, including the gravitational constant, which was equal to 6.82×11 meters in a cube divided by kilograms and seconds in squares. The result was 2.2 percent higher than the value recommended by the Committee for Science and Technology Data at the International Council for Science (CODATA). The physicists admitted, however, that the error of their experiment was still many orders of magnitude greater than in the experiments of other groups. In the future, they hope to reduce it significantly by adding noise control, such as active anti-vibration protection. Despite the inaccuracies, the authors' work is of technical interest to physicists and engineers seeking gravitational waves, as the characteristic frequency of gravitational waves detected by LIGO and Virgo lies within the range of hundreds of Hertz.

    "translated_title": "The splitting of mammoth bones has been traced back to the Americas 37 thousand years ago .",
    "translated_text": "American researchers have unearthed a site in New Mexico where the remains of the mammoth were previously discovered. The bones were found to be those of an adult female and a baby that lived about 37,000 years ago. On their bones, scientists have found numerous traces of bruising and splitting. Together with stone artifacts and remains of ancient fire, these finds suggest that humans may have appeared in America long before the generally accepted date. This is reported in an article published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. There is no consensus among scientists on the time and routes of settlement of America. For a long time, the ancient inhabitants of this continent were the representatives of the Clovis archaeological culture, which existed about 13,510,8 thousand years ago. But subsequent studies have shown that humans arrived in America earlier, giving rise to the so-called pre-Clovis concept. It is safe to say that the first Americans arrived south of the ice sheets 1615 thousand years ago. According to one version, the settlement of America took place in several waves, the first of which was about 30,000 years ago, the second during the last glaciation, and the third during the Greenland interglacial. Paleo-climatic and paleobotanical reconstructions suggest that this could hardly have happened before 23,000 years ago. One of the most striking findings of early human settlement in America was made last year by scientists from the United Kingdom and the United States. In New Mexico, they found 61 distinct human footprints. According to radio-carbon analysis, the age of these finds is about 2123 thousand years. There are also a number of older evidence of settlement on this continent, but many critics point out that such assumptions are based largely on questionable findings. For example, recently, it was reported that the oldest human settlement in Mexico was about 31  33 thousand years old. However, other archaeologists disagreed, saying that the stone objects discovered had become like tools of labor as a result of natural geological processes. Timothy Rowe of the University of Texas at Austin, along with colleagues from Denmark and the United States, investigated the remains of mammoths found at Hartley's site. It's on the Colorado Plateau in northern New Mexico. This location was discovered by chance by a man named Gary Hartley while walking on a wildlife trail. Then he found a beetle and some bones exposed from the debris. In addition, a few meters away, the obsidian end of the Clovis culture and stone fragments were located on the surface of the earth. Initially, scientists assumed that Hartley was the site of a mammoth massacre, a part of the Clovis culture. However, stone artifacts may have remained there from other times, so archaeologists began excavation. As a result of this work, they found the remains of an adult female mammoth and a baby. In addition to the bones, scientists also had six microparticles. To determine the age of the animals, scientists sent the remains for direct radiocarbon analysis using accelerated mass spectrometry, which was conducted in several laboratories. The six calibrated dates revealed that mammoths lived between 3890036250 and 3325031300 years ago. According to the researchers, the most reliable date in this case is the oldest. The scientists also examined animal bones using computer and microcomputer tomography, and analyzed deposits using a raster electron microscope. They found no trace of teeth or other damage left by the predators on the mammoth bones. But on the skull and the postcranial skeleton, they found a number of traces, probably made with stone tools. For example, the forehead and femur bones may be damaged by blunt force trauma. In addition, many bones have punctures of between two millimeters and one centimeter in diameter, cracks, and other damage that was done when the bones were fresh. Scientists noted that 32 bone fractures were a feature of this location, 15 of which have sharp and cutting-ready edges, as well as a number of butterfly-shaped bone fragments. The latter appear to have been formed by the impact of a blunt object on the bones. Analysis of the deposits using microscopy allowed researchers to discover evidence that fire was being lit at this site in ancient times. So they noticed a small calcined bone inclusions. This suggests that these bones were burned. In addition, the CT showed that the ashes were also found on some of the animal remains studied. The researchers concluded that the data obtained suggested that ancient humans appeared in what is now New Mexico some 37,000 years ago. Moreover, they suggested that people first arrived in North America long before that, since Hartley's parking lot is located deep in the American continent. After the note was published, we changed the title. Previously on N+1, they talked about other jobs about settling America. For example, paleontologists have studied the morphology of the teeth of the Ainu and the inhabitants of Japan during the Jemon period and have disproved the hypothesis that America was settled by Japanese. And geologists have found that the earliest inhabitants of America could not use the Mackenzie Corridor to move from Beringia to the south. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "The rabies vector vaccine has caused antibodies to form in humans after the first dose .",
    "translated_text": "Oxford scientists tested a rabies vaccine on humans, developed on the same principle as the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. In fact, it was invented before the pandemic, and it was just preventing us from starting testing earlier. The first phase results found the drug to be safe and immune. But most importantly, it causes antibodies to form after the first dose, unlike other rabies vaccines. The report on the tests was published in The Lancet. Although Louis Pasteur invented the rabies vaccine, the disease still kills tens of thousands of people a year. And the problem isn't so much with the vaccines themselves, as with how to organize a vaccination campaign. Vaccines approved today require multiple injections and are quite expensive because they are made from \"killed\" virus particles. So they're not included in national calendars and they're asking anyone who's been bitten to seek post-contact prevention. But not everyone can do it quickly  especially rural people, where anger is more common. Alternatively, you could have a rabies vaccine. But the virus can infect a wide variety of mammals. And if dogs can still be vaccinated in large numbers, in areas where bats are the main carriers of infection, it's virtually impossible to get rid of rabies. So a group of scientists from Oxford University led by Alexander Douglas (Alexander D. Douglas) has been working on a vaccine that would be easier to produce and spread. Researchers have developed a vector vaccine based on the monkey adenovirus AdC68, which carries a gene from one of the surface proteins of the smallpox virus. It's been tested on mice and monkeys and it's been shown to produce antibodies and protect against viral infection. They started clinical trials on humans and recruited the first volunteers, but they were blocked by the COVID pandemic. It prevented more participants from being recruited, and some people who had already been vaccinated were unable to get to the test in time. But during the pandemic, the same technology was used to develop a vector coronavirus vaccine (truly, based on another adenovirus) at Oxford University, in collaboration with AstraZeneca. Now that the technology is working, the researchers are back to the rabies vaccine. The first phase of the trials involved 12 British subjects: three received a low dose of  5 × 109 virus particles, three more received a medium dose, and six received a maximum dose of  5 × 1010 particles (standard dosage for AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine). For eight weeks, doctors monitored their health and blood levels of neutralizing antibodies. During this time, there were no serious side effects in vaccinated patients. They mostly complained of mild pain at the injection site and fever (especially in the group that received the high dose), but they went through in 12 days. Before the vaccine, doctors hadn't found any of the antibodies to rabies in the test subjects. Two months after vaccination , 11 out of 12 people (except one in the lowest-dose group) had antibodies . A year later, the researchers were able to take blood tests from nine participants and found antibodies in seven of them, still in sufficient numbers. Then the doctors suggested that the subjects get the vaccine again, but this time with a \"traditional\" drug approved in the UK. So the researchers wanted to model the situation: people get vaccinated first, then within a year, their antibodies partially disappear, and after contact with an infected animal, they turn to another vaccine to quickly increase their antibody concentration. Nine participants received three injections of an inactivated rabies vaccine and the number of antibodies increased sharply within a week or two. The researchers claim that their results are  \"the most positive\" among single-use rabies vaccines. But they also note that they will need the next phases of testing to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. For example, it is not known whether such a vaccine will be linked to the risk of thrombosis  as was the case with the coronavirus vaccine. However, the developers of the new drug believe that the benefits of preventing death from rabies will still outweigh the risks. The authors also believe that other technologies can be used to create a vaccine against rabies  for example, mRNA vaccines, which have also performed well during the pandemic. However, they say vector vaccines are much cheaper to manufacture  and the technology to scale this production has been perfected in recent years. We've written about how scientists calculated that catching and sleeping angry dogs is not as effective as mass vaccination. And we also told a story about rabbits who were suspected of rage, but it turned out to be completely unfair. Polina Loseva"

    "translated_title": "Archaeologists have discovered a medieval tomb in Old Ladoga",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists discovered a previously unknown ground tomb in the Old Ladoga during excavations of the settlement of the XIVXVIII centuries. More than a dozen burials were found in the excavation, which were carried out in Christian tradition. The intersecting tombs, according to researchers, indicate how long the burial complex has been in use. This is reported in the press release of the Institute of the History of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Old Ladoga (until 1704  Ladoga) is the oldest settlement in north-west Russia, where life continues to this day. It is located in the Leningrad region on the banks of the Volkhov River, about 11 kilometers from the Ladoga Lake. In the early Middle Ages, the port was located here, and there was also trade in goods from different remote regions. It was Ladoga, according to the most reliable version of the \"Tellings of the Call of the Varangians\", that became the residence of Rurik in 862. Old Ladoga has preserved historical natural landscape, rare architectural works and ancient settlement planning dating back to the XXII centuries. The presence of a cultural layer with well-preserved remains of buildings and ethnically diverse finds from the VIIXVII centuries makes Ladogou one of the most important medieval eastern European cities. The wet layers of this settlement, which reach a capacity of fifty feet [55 m], have created conditions for the preservation of organic material to this day. Dendrochronology has shown that the oldest known wooden structures in Ladoga were built from wood cut down in 753. Researchers from the Old Old Archaeological Expedition of the Institute of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences reported the first results of the excavations of the current season. Scientists have discovered a previously unknown medieval ground tomb on the territory of modern Old Ladoga. This burial complex was found during the exploration of the remains of the settlement of the XIVXVIII centuries. Archaeologists noted that more than 12 burials were found in the excavation site, which were carried out according to Christian tradition in clay pits with a western orientation. In some cases, the burial pits were covered. This indicates that the cemetery has been used for burials for a long time. In addition, some of the burials were damaged by agricultural activity. The scientists stressed that the written sources do not mention the tomb, so they need to do further research to determine its age. Recently, the N+1 was talking about the first findings of excavations this season at other medieval monuments. So, archaeologists report the first ever found this year in Old Russia. In addition, during the work in Gnezdo, researchers found the confirmation of written evidence about the burial ritual of the Russians. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "In Slovakia, a mass burial of people without the skulls of the Neolithic era was discovered",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have discovered in Slovakia a mass burial of people who died around 52504950 BC. They dug into the trench numerous bones belonging to at least 35 individuals, many of whom were teenagers. Scientists have noted that only one skull was found among these remains. This is reported in the press release of the Institute of Archaeology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. Mass burials in which victims of one event (such as an armed encounter, epidemic or ritual killing) are buried are relatively rare in the context of ancient times. In Europe, similar objects from the Neolithic period are known. For example, during excavations in Talheim, Germany, archaeologists discovered a pit about three metres long containing the remains of 18 adults and 16 children who died by force, as evidenced by numerous injuries. This object belongs to the linear-pentean ceramics culture and dates from about 49004800 BC. Another example of a mass burial (Aspart-Schlötz), belonging to the same culture, was discovered by archaeologists in Austria. There, in the ravine surrounding the settlement, researchers found the remains of 67 people killed around 5207,4849 B.C.E. Examples of mass burials of people without visible signs of violence are also known, such as the Mannville settlement in France or the Widerstadt monument in Germany. The mass burial of the culture of ball-shaped amphorae, discovered in 2011 near the Polish village of Koshice, also draws attention. There, archaeologists unearthed the remains of 15 men, women, and children who died about 28802776 B.C.E. Anthropologists have determined that all of these people were killed by bludgeoning to the head. Paleogenetic analysis showed that the remains belonged to seven women and eight men who were in a relationship. And the people who buried them knew it. They placed the bodies of close relatives next to each other, such as mothers and children and brothers and sisters. The joint expedition of the Institute of Archaeology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences and the University of Kiel under the leadership of Dr. Ivan Cheben (Ivan Cheben) is exploring one of the largest settlement complexes of the Stone Age in Central Europe, discovered in the small town of Vrable in southern Slovakia. The monument, which covers an area of about 50 hectares, is dated by archaeologists to about 5250-4950 BC, the Neolithic era. Detailed geophysical surveys of the settlement revealed the remains of more than 300 long houses. At the same time, researchers estimate that at each individual stage of the settlement's existence, the number of such residential buildings could reach 5070 pieces. In addition, the settlement was surrounded by moats and frequencies. Archaeologists have noted that they have been found in the settlement since the previous seasons. However, this year they dug a trench that contained a large pile of human bones. The researchers estimate that at least 35 people were buried there. According to anthropologist Zuzana Hukelova of the Institute of Archaeology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, the bodies of the deceased were originally buried in different positions, such as lying on their backs, stomachs, sides and in the posture of frogs. She noted that almost all of these people lack skulls. Archaeologists found only one that belonged to the child. Preliminary estimates suggest that many of these people were teenagers. With further research, scientists hope to find out why all these people ended up in a common grave. They may have been victims of mass violence, epidemics, or sacrifices as part of a ritual. The researchers also intend to find out how these people are genetically related and to determine when they lost their skulls. In addition to this mass burial, archaeologists have discovered a perforated human tooth that may have been part of an amulet. Previously on N + 1 they told about the mass burial excavated in the city of Vladimir. The nature of the injuries led to the conclusion that these people were victims of an armed cavalry squad, possibly part of the Mongol campaign of 1238. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "The amorphous organic polymer was a conductor .",
    "translated_text": "American and Korean chemists synthesized an amorphous polymer based on nickel salt with thios substitute tetratiafuulvalen. The resulting material was completely amorphous, but it had a proportional electrical conductivity of 1200 semes per centimeter. The unexpected ability of amorphous material to conduct current was explained by the authors of the Nature article as structure-resistant by the interactions between its molecules. Most materials based on organic or metallic organic compounds do not conduct electricity. But chemists can create conductive organic materials. To do this, they either add conductivity-enhancing mixtures to the finished material or obtain crystal samples of polymers. Their orderly structure allows the electric current to flow without any special obstacles. But amorphous organic materials don't usually conduct current. But chemists led by John Anderson of the University of Chicago were able to produce a conductive amorphous metal-organic material. For this, they took the nickel salt tetrachloronicate tetraethylammonium and mixed its solution with a tetraetiafulvalene derivative. The reaction produced a polymer made of nickel atoms linked to fulvalene cycles via sulfur atoms. Its structure was confirmed by elementary analysis and photoelectronic spectroscopy. X-ray analysis of the polymer found it to be completely amorphous. Measuring the electrical conductivity of the polymer samples pressed at room temperature yielded a yield strength of about 470 semesters per centimeter. And when pressing was done at 200 degrees Celsius, the conductivity increased to 1,200 semesters per centimeter. This behavior of the amorphous material surprised chemists, and they decided to study its structure. Scientists first tried to get crystal samples of their polymers, and they were able to get partially crystal samples by slow crystallization. It turned out that the crystals were made of two-dimensional polymer sheets folded into a pile on top of each other. And chemists have also observed the two-dimensional sheets themselves in the structure of amorphous material, but in it, they were disorderly. Theoretical modeling of the crystal structure of a polymer using density functional theory has shown that there is a strong pi-stecking interaction between the polymer layers, and the overlapping of the electron clouds of sulfur atoms leads to additional stabilization. And when chemists analyzed the amorphous structure, not the crystal structure, these interactions persisted. That is, despite the disordered arrangement of the atoms, the electronic structure of amorphous material was virtually no different from the structure of crystals. It is because of this, chemists believe, that amorphous material became a conductor. To determine how convenient the material was to be used as a conductor, chemists decided to study its durability. It turns out that the polymer retains its structure when heated to 235 degrees Celsius in the air, and its conductivity remains constant in the temperature range of 20 to 140 degrees Celsius. In addition, keeping the material in moist air for a month did not reduce conductivity. Chemists were able to obtain a heating and moisture-resistant organic conductor with a maximum electrical conductivity of 1,200 semesters per centimeter. This is not the only example of the unusual transport properties of metal amorphous bodies. We've told you before that some of the atoms in metal glass move like liquid through thread-like trajectories even at cold temperatures."

    "translated_title": "Machine learning helped to find optimal conditions for Suzuki's reaction",
    "translated_text": "Chemists from the United States, Canada and South Korea were able to optimize the conditions for cross-combining reactions on Suzuki using machine learning. Thanks to the automated reaction analysis and training system, scientists have doubled the average response rate. The study was published in Science. The Suzuki reaction is a combination of two molecules: boric acid and organic halogenide. Under the action of a palladium-based catalyst and in the presence of a base, these molecules combine to form a carbon-carbon bond. These compounds are very popular in medical chemistry because they often yield good results and allow for easy variation of the replacements (organic fragments) on the required molecule. To do this, you just need to get one halogenide and several boric acids and then combine the halogenide with each of them. One of the problems with Suzuki's reaction is that some boric acids are unstable  they decompose when stored. This is especially true of heterocyclic compound acids, which are often used to synthesize medicines. But in 2009, chemists in the United States proposed using boronic acid instead of N-methyliminoxydioxyric acid. They have a boron atom attached to two oxygen atoms and are further stabilized by a nitrogen atom. This makes these compounds stable when stored in the air under room lighting. Overall, the development by American scientists has been very productive and has allowed for the production of high-output heterocyclic products of the Suzuki reaction. Although the most convenient and reliable way to conduct the Suzuki reaction seems to have been found, chemists led by Martin Burke (Martin D. Burke, from the University of Illinois, decided to improve her condition with machine learning. To do this, the scientists selected about 5,400 commercially available heterosexual compounds, from which they clustered 54 of the most structurally diverse heterosexuals for further research. Then, to shorten the dataset even more, the scientists applied an algorithm based on the concept of chemical resemblance. This allowed us to remove the most similar structures and leave the most diverse. As a result, chemists were able to isolate 11 pairs of borate-halogenides to find optimal reaction conditions. To perform the Suzuki reaction, the scientists used an automatic synthesis device in which all the reactions were under the same conditions, and the machine measured the output automatically using chromatomasse spectrometry or UV spectroscopy. Chemists began with the Suzuki reaction between 11 pairs of substrates with several palladium catalysts in different solvents and in the presence of different bases (each reaction was repeated twice for reliability). The data was enough to start learning the model. Chemists used a standard Bayesian optimization algorithm in combination with active learning (in this way, the machine periodically requests the user to provide the data it needs) to avoid conducting all possible experiments with 11 substrates. At the same time, the machine evaluated the accuracy of the prediction itself by using the Gauss process regression after each optimization cycle. In the process, chemists had to perform about 200 more reactions. And after five cycles of optimization, the scientists decided to test the optimal conditions they found -- a mixture of dioxin and water as a solvent, a palladium complex with XPhos ligand as a catalyst, sodium carbonate as a base, and a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. The conditions found were to significantly increase the conversion of the original product and the ratio of the amount of the desired product to the amount of the by-products compared to the experiments described earlier. The average output of 20 tested reactions was 46 percent, twice as much as in the 2009 article. Although cross-linking was discovered in the late 19th century, new catalysts are still being discovered. For example, we recently talked about how chemists first performed a Heck reaction on a gold catalyst."

    "translated_title": "Russian physicists have recorded a plasma heating in the globus-M2 spherical tocomak",
    "translated_text": "Russian physicists working on the globus-m2 spherical tocomak have heated the deuterium plasma to a very high temperature, which is twice as low as the future thermonuclear reactor iter. The plasma volume is a thousand times smaller than that of ITER, and the magnetic field is five times weaker. Such research is important for the development of future thermonuclear reactors based on spheromacs, which could be cheaper and more profitable than conventional tokamakes, the press service of the Ministry of Science said in a report to N + 1. The concept of spherical tokamakes, which have an aspect (the ratio of the large radius to the small) is close to the unit, which is less than in conventional tokamakes, was developed in the late last century and then experimentally confirmed by a number of devices, such as START. Its purpose is to improve the retention and parameters of high-temperature plasma while reducing the size of the thermonuclear system and, as a result, reducing the cost of its creation and maintenance. However, there are many unresolved physical and engineering challenges in the process of building such a reactor. Currently, the world is conducting research in the field of spheromacs on a number of new generation installations such as the \"Globus-M2\" (RF), MAST and ST-40 (UK), NSTX (USA) or TST-2 (Japan). The Globe-M was launched at the A. F. Iof RAN in 1999. The aspect ratio for the tocomak is 1.5, and the volume of the steel vacuum chamber is about 1.1 cubic meters. Primary heating of the hydrogen or deuterium plasma is done by creating and increasing the current flowing in the plasma cord, using a central solenoid (inductor), then connecting the wave heating systems (LHCD and ICRF) and the injection of high-energy neutrals. Most plasma-containing elements inside the chamber are lined with graphite tiles that are coated with boron carbide during weekly burning procedures. In 2018 The system was substantially upgraded in the 1960s, with the designation \"Globus-M2\", the second neutral injector and a renewed electromagnetic system, which increased the magnitude of the toroid magnetic field from 0.4 to 1 Tesla. Now, for the first time, scientists working at Tokamak have been able to obtain a record high plasma temperature among domestic devices of this type. The resulting temperature of the deauterium ions was 4 kV at a Tesla 0.9 torid field voltage and a discharge retention time of 10-12 milliseconds. Similar plasma parameters were obtained by using both high-energy plasma hydrogen atomic beam injectors. For comparison  the ITER international thermonuclear reactor project is expected to achieve an ionic temperature of 8 kV, with a plasma volume in the \"Globus-M2\" a thousand times smaller than in ITER, and a magnetic field five times weaker, although the design time of combustion of the discharge in ITER is much greater. However, the discharge retention time in the Globe-M is large enough to set this size. According to Deputy Head of the Globe-M2 Vladimir Mineev, the plasma parameters obtained are consistent with the calculation parameters predicted earlier for this installation and obtained for the British ST-40 tocomac. At the same time, it should be noted that the \"Globus-M2\" has almost reached the upper limit in terms of available magnetic field and in addition to continuing work on the installation will be developed a new next-generation tokamak, which will be 2-2.5 times larger in size than the current one. It will give you a denser, hotter plasma. Earlier, we talked about the \"competition\" between the EAST and KSTAR tocomakers, who alternately set records for holding very hot plasma, and the physical launch of the new Russian T-15MD tocomak.

    "translated_text": "Swiss scientists have found that clicking sounds within 60 decibels, which are played through the earphones of older people during sleep, help to amplify slow waves, which in turn have a positive effect on sleep quality. They also determined that the difference in the effectiveness of acoustic effects is most likely due to the decrease in the duration and number of slow waves. The article was published in Communications Medicine. Sleep is an integral part of every person's life, but with age, sleep duration and quality decline. In older people, sleep often becomes more superficial and fragmented, and scientists link this to a decrease in slow waves, which are the dominant low frequency rhythms of the brain during slow sleep. It is believed that deep sleep is one of the most important stages of sleep during which the body rests and recovers. So scientists have been studying deep sleep strategies for a long time, so, for example, some studies show that exposure to various stimulations (mostly  acoustic) at a certain rhythm during sleep helps increase slow-wave activity, which in turn can improve sleep quality. Yet no technology for hearing aid has yet proven itself to be a certified medical wearable device that could be used by ordinary people, including the elderly. This is largely because there are no controlled, randomized clinical trials to date that study the effects of home hearing stimulation on sleep and daytime functioning in people of all ages. A team of scientists led by Dr. Caroline Lustenberger of the University of Zurich developed a portable device for sleep monitoring and modulating slow waves with feedback and conducted a randomized cross-sectional study that examined the effects of upward-facing hearing stimulation on sleep and the daytime well-being of older people. The experiment was conducted on 16 participants aged 60 to 80 years without a diagnosis of sleep disorders. In addition, using basic audiometry, the researchers confirmed that volunteers could hear sound at a level of 50 decibels (each ear). All experiments were conducted remotely, meaning that the participants continued their normal lives at home. The first night was a familiar one, and people got used to a device that kept monitoring the electrical activity of the brain and recorded EEGs (electroencephalograms), EOGs (electrocuelograms) and EMGs (electromiograms). Then, for four weeks, participants received or received no hearing stimulation in a random order during deep sleep, with one hearing stimulation being used continuously, and another stimulation being activated for 6 seconds with a break of 6 seconds. Once the device detected slow waves during sleep, it would emit clicking sound signals through the earphones, depending on the stimulus option, changing the signal duration. To avoid waking participants, the volume of sound signals was adapted to the depth of sleep and individual response to the stimulus (minimum 46 decibels, maximum 60 decibels). After analyzing and filtering the recorded data, the scientists found that sound effects actually amplified slow waves in some subjects, while they practically did not affect others. It turns out that those who didn't respond to or responded poorly to hearing stimuli were much older than those who were significantly affected by hearing stimuli. Scientists note that the difference in acoustic performance is not due to differences in hearing thresholds, but that with age, not only the number of slow waves decreases, but also their duration. So a difference of just a few years can lead to a marked difference in the effectiveness of the stimulus. In the future, scientists plan to develop a method to predict how well a device will work on a specific person, so that it can be personalized and thus improve performance. Slow waves are linked not only to the quality of deep sleep, but also to the reactivation of information to form memory. Neurophysiologists have studied the mechanisms of memory formation during sleep and found that complexes of slow waves and sleep wires play an important role in memory consolidation (transition of memories from short-term to long-term memory).

    "translated_text": "The James Webb infrared space telescope has found a number of organic molecules, including complex ones, in the ice particles of the very young protostar IRAS 15398−3359. In addition, the telescope examined the structure of one of the protostar material outflows, which consists of four shells. The print of the work is published on the arXiv website. The first is the Internet. The nature of complex organic molecules in young protostars remains an important question in astrochemistry and theories describing the mechanisms of star formation. These molecules, made up of six or more atoms, may be precursors to prebiotic molecules. They were previously found in the gas phase in the nuclei of large and small protostars. They have also been found in small bodies in the solar system, such as comets, and in some cases, the content of complex organic molecules coincides with that of the protostars. These compounds are thought to form in the surface layer of ice dust inside protostars. Thus, the study of the chemical composition and processes within protostars allows to characterize the chemical composition of protoplanetary disks that form around young stars, in which planets form. A group of astronomers led by Klaus Pontopidán (Klaus M. Pontoppidan) from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland presented the results of the first spectroscopic observations of the James Webb Space Observatory on the CORINOS (COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next Generation Observatory in Space) program. Their target was a very young protostar of class 0 IRAS 15398−3359, located in the molecular cloud Lupus 1 at a distance of 505.5 light years from Earth. Previous observations have revealed the presence of a protoplanetary disk. Class 0 means that the star is still very cold (bolometric temperature about 43.2 kelvins) and surrounded by a cloud of gas and dust. The observations were conducted on July 20, 2022 using the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) in the average infrared range. Researchers have detected radiation from warm water vapor and gaseous carbon dioxide, indicating the presence of a near-stellar disk. They reliably detected several types of ice particles containing water, methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide, CH3OH, H2CO, and HCOOH. In addition, spectra indicate the possible presence of NH+4, HCOO-, C2H5OH, CH3CHO and HCOOCH3 particles, and the images obtained show a collimated bipolar structure consisting of four shells that is one of the protostar material outflows. The scientists note that these results show the enormous potential of the MIRI tool in the study of the composition of protoplanetary disks and the nucleus of protostars. We've been talking about how a black hole in the middle of the Milky Way helped give birth to new stars."

    "translated_text": "Physicists have raised the proton energy in the ring of the Large Hadron Collider to a record value of 6.8 tera-electronvolts per beam  This means that the energy of particle collisions (when collision experiments begin on the collidor) can be brought to 13.6 tera-electronvolts, the official tweet of CERN said. Thus, a decade after launch, the accelerator was closely approaching the design energy of the collisions at 14 teraelectronvolts. This was originally planned to be achieved in 2014. The large hadron collider, first launched in September 2008, was reactivated on April 22 after a three-year halt to repair and upgrade. It was the second long-term shutdown in its history, the first one lasting from 2013 to 2015. During the second session of work (Run 2), which lasted until 2018, the energy of protons was raised to 6.5 teraelectronvolts per beam. Initial plans for the work suggested that the projected 7 tera-electron volts per beam would be released in 2014, but this was delayed because the collidor's superconducting magnets were not trained enough to work on this energy and in 2015 the collidor was powered at only 6.5 tera-electron volts per beam. Now the power has been increased to 6.8 teravolts, but that's a record for just the installation of the  proton collision itself and data collection with detectors not yet started. According to the collider's schedule, the proton collision experimentation session will begin on August 4, 2022. In this session, the collider will, in particular, test the W-bozon mass anomaly discovered by scientists analyzing data from the American Tevatron collider.

    "translated_title": "Paleogenetics have diagnosed brucellosis in a 14th century Italian blessed monk",
    "translated_text": "Paleogenetics have studied the remains of a 14th-century Italian monk who was beatified. They analyzed 14 samples of bone, soft tissue and calcinate and found that the man had brucellosis. It turns out that the ancient DNA of the pathogen is best preserved in calcinates, which may be kidney stones or bladder stones. This is reported in an article published in the International Journal of Paleopathology. Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. They infect mainly cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and dogs. People are usually infected by direct contact with such animals, by eating animal products, and by inhaling airborne pathogens. However, the most common cause is raw sheep's or goat's milk and cheese. B is the most common type of brucellosis in humans worldwide. It's called melitensis. Infected people usually experience nonspecific symptoms after one to six weeks, such as fever, weakness, discomfort, and pain in the head, muscles and joints. The symptoms of the lateral motor system, the cardiovascular system, and the nervous system are also present. Chronic brucellosis often develops arthritis (inflammation of joints), pathologies of connective tissue in the area of elbow joints, lumbar spine and cross (e.g., fibrosis and cellulite), as well as spondylitis  inflammatory diseases of the spine. Jessica Hider of McMaster University, together with colleagues from Italy, Canada and the United States, has examined the remains of Giantate Brancorsini, an Italian monk who lived from 1343 to 1394, and who was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1769. Some of his bones, like his spine, paleopathologists have identified brucellosis-like lesions. Next to the spines in the abdominal and pelvic cavities of this man, scientists found calcinates, which analysis showed were kidney or bladder stones, calcined lymph nodes, or calcinates of the liver and spleen. For the paleogenetic analysis, the researchers selected 14 samples that were calcinates, bone fragments, and preserved soft tissue. In three calcinates, paleogenetics have found enough ancient DNA to assert that it belonged to the grammar-setting bacterium Brucella melitensis. Also, the researchers read the monk's mitochondrial genome. It turned out that it belonged to the haplogroup HV1b, which is widespread among the populations of Southern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Researchers have noted that people are usually infected with B. Melitensis when consuming unpasteurized sheep or goat milk products. In Italy, including the region where the monk lived, there is a long tradition of making and consuming cheese from sheep's milk. Furthermore, the scientists stressed that they could not safely diagnose brucellosis in this person if they relied on bone and soft tissue alone. Apparently, calcification contributed to better preservation of the pathogen's DNA. Previously on N+1, we've been told about other cases where paleogenetics have been able to read the DNA of ancient pathogens. For example, the remains of individuals living about four thousand years ago were found in Crete infected with the common rod (Yersinia pestis) and salmonella (Salmonella enterica). Also, scientists recently read the DNA of a pumpkin for the first time and found out that he had tuberculosis. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "Physicists measured the safe height of diving in different positions",
    "translated_text": "American biomechanics researchers have experimentally and theoretically studied human dives in three different positions, as well as similar dives in animals. Experiments with 3D-printed mannequins helped verify the immense mathematical models that describe the initial moment of impact on water and calculate the maximum load on the human body. It turns out that for kidneys, the safe height is 8 meters, the hands 12 meters, and the feet 15 meters. The study was published in Science Advances. The situation of a solid object hitting the surface of water at high speed is common in both living and mechanical life, and it is therefore of great concern to scientists. Crossing the air-water boundary is accompanied by a complex balance between inertia, surface tension, gravity and viscosity. The result of this interaction can be both an impressive Olympic kidney without spraying and busy jumps on the surface of the water of flat, rotating stones. It is noteworthy that the powerful push to build appropriate physical models gave the search for optimal forms for warheads during World War II. Now the theory is used to understand how animals and humans dive, how robots walk on water, and to improve the rowing fun. The human body is worse suited to diving than the bodies of animals that do it regularly. For example, the bully (Sulidae) uses a dense layer of feathers behind their heads to transmit the force of impact to their long, flexible neck. Unlike humans, humans have no anatomical devices to protect them from water. Amateur diving is one of the main causes of head and spinal injuries. And while for more than a century of the history of water sports, professionals have developed recommendations for proper diving, quantitative estimates of how exactly the force is distributed in the human body in different positions have not been made. A group of American biomechanics specialists led by Anupam Pandey of Cornell University decided to do this. For this, they threw 3D-printed mannequins into the water equipped with force sensors that depicted people in different diving positions (hands forward, head forward and legs forward), as well as animals diving in a similar manner. The data helped scientists build a quantitative model in all three cases that links body parameters and height of fall to the body's load. From the physics of the processes that occur when crossing the air-water boundary, head-falling forward has much in common with the kidney of an ordinary sea pig (Phocoena phocoena), the forearms of the northern bulge (Morus bassanus), and the forearms of the slam-bearing basilisk (Basiliscus basiliscus), known for its ability to run on water thanks to flat paws. The authors began their research with experiments and modeling the kidneys of the first two animals. They used a simplified Karman model, which describes the volume of added water mass that creates a force of impact as a hemisphere with a radius equal to the radius of the body's incision falling into the water. According to the model, the resulting force at the initial moment of impact is determined by the shape of the falling body. The morse of the sea pig was described by the researchers as a paraboloid, and the bulsh as a cone. Calculations showed that for such geometries the force of impact increases with time according to the square root and the square of time laws, respectively, which was in good agreement with the experiment up to the time when the hydrodynamic flow disruption came into play. The authors called the corresponding periods the shock phase. Then the scientists tried to adapt these results to human postures. So, the elliptical cone of the hand jumping forward was good, but the head didn't match the parabolic, so the formula had to be adjusted. The researchers unified their model by moving to dimensionless quantities, which included body size and water entry speed. Comparing the unlimited dependencies with the empirical data showed that this theory satisfactoryly describes both humans and animals. Unlike the first two cases, a human foot or a basilisk's paw is struck by water of a completely different character. It is accompanied by an instantaneous increase in contact area and a sharp jump in impact force, and therefore the previously used model is not applicable in this case. Moreover, the force begins to oscillate over time at a high frequency, which physicists explain as the oscillations caused by the capture of air bubbles. The data collected helped scientists estimate the total pulse a person receives during the shock phase, as well as the body's load. The physicians, who strongly depend on the height of the fall, compared it to a literature-known load that causes damage to individual organs. In the case of a head-forward kidney, it is primarily a compression injury to the head and spine, and in the other cases, it is a bone and muscle injury to the limbs. According to calculations, the maximum safe height of the kidney for the head kidney was 8 meters, the hands forward 12 meters, the feet forward 15 meters. The authors note, however, that the literary data was obtained through experiments with corpses. Living humans can use different motor units and control the voltage of the connections. So the height at which professional divers can jump safely into the water can be as high as 26 meters. We've talked about how the same mathematical model describes the pressure that diving animals experience and the pull that wings and fins create. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "Researchers suspected the DALL-E 2 neuron has its own dictionary",
    "translated_text": "American researchers have discovered unusual features in the generative neural network DALL-E 2, which creates text-description images. The text in her images, which seems to be a random set of characters, is probably not at all, and is often associated with specific objects and concepts. For example, when requested by \"Apoploe vesrreaitais\", the model usually generates images of birds. The researchers suggested that DALL-E 2 forms its own dictionary likeness during learning. The article, which has not yet been reviewed, is available on the author's website. It has sparked a lot of discussion among the machine learning community, which has denied some of the authors' theses and confirmed others. DALL-E 2  is a new and improved version of the generative DALL-E neural network introduced by OpenAI in early 2021. The researchers then told us about two similar models: DALL-E and CLIP. They actually do the opposite: DALL-E generates a realistic image based on its text description given by a human, and CLIP generates a text description for the image given to it. In both cases, models were trained on a huge volume of images and descriptions and were able to learn the qualitative relationship between visual and textual representation of objects and concepts. In the DALL-E 2 that was released this spring, the developers changed some of the details of the implementation and were able to improve the realism of the images it generated. However, she still has some notable problems, one of which is the generation of inscriptions. Usually the model generates either a set of Latin characters in the wrong order, or uses nonexistent symbols or patterns. OpenAI has traditionally not provided code and full versions of its models, and this time it has launched an on-demand demo where researchers can test the model's performance by giving it a text description and getting a set of images. Giannis Daras and Alexandros Dimakis of the University of Texas at Austin, who gained access to the demo, found that the random text in the images does not seem to be so random. They loaded a model of the description of a scene, saying that it needs to generate text. For example, in response to the phrase \"Two whales talking about food, with subtitles. The model generated two whales and an indistinct set of symbols, which is best expressed by the Latin symbols in the phrase \"Wa ch zod ahaakes rea\". The authors found that if you load this seemingly meaningless phrase into the model, it generates images of different seafood. Similarly, they discovered some other phrases and words that are consistently linked to specific concepts, such as the \"Apoploe vesrreaitais\" model most often generates birds. And in this case, they learned about this phrase by asking two farmers to generate a conversation about vegetables. They also found that sometimes the model generates images with the combination of these phrases correctly. So they first found that when asked about Contarra ccetnxniams luryca tanniounons, DALL-E 2 often generates bugs and other insects, and in response to the phrase \"Apoploe vesrreaitais eating Contarra ccetnxniams luryca tanniounons\", it can generate images of birds eating bugs. The researchers suggested that they had discovered a \"hidden language\" in DALL-E 2 and published the paper. It has sparked a heated debate in the community of developers and researchers. Benjamin Hitton showed that some of the examples given by the authors are often untrue and seem to have been caused either by coincidence or by the search for successful generation options. For example, in response to the phrase \"Contarra ccetnxniams luryca tanniounons\", he most often received different animals, not specifically bugs (though they were often in the results). Moreover, if you add a style specification to this phrase, the supposed connection between the concept of \"juice\" and this phrase disappears altogether: if you ask the model to generate \"Contarra ccetnxniams luryca tanniounons\" in the style of a drawing, it stably paints older women, and if you ask to do a 3D render, you get renderings of shells, dinosaurs and other objects. At the same time, he and another researcher confirmed that the DALL-E 2 actually generates birds steadily, according to the phrase \"Apoploe vesrreaitais\". A possible explanation for this was found by a Twitter user named BarneyFlames. He discovered that the CLIP tokenizer used in DALL-E 2 to convert text into embedding breaks the phrase \"Apoploe vesrreaitais\" into the tokens apo, plo, e, ,ve, sr, re, ait and ais. The first two tokens are found in the early names of the Apodidae and Ploceidae family of birds. He suggested that the model could get most of the information about birds from scientific illustrations. Thus, when generating bird images, DALL-E 2 can form text from tokens that it most often encountered in descriptions of bird photographs during training. After criticism from other researchers, the authors published a revised version of the article, which used the term \"hidden dictionary\" instead of \"hidden language\". Last year, developers from Sber created a Russian-language version of the first DALL-E. Since they used translated images to create the dataset, the final model also encountered unexpected bugs with bird images, which can be found in more detail on our blog \"Better blue in the hand: about translation difficulties\".

    "translated_title": "Physicists have confirmed the validity of the special theory of relativity with respect to the field of a fast-flying charge .",
    "translated_text": "Japanese physicists have experimentally confirmed that the Kulon field of charges moving at speeds close to the speed of light is compressed exactly as predicted by special relativity. To do this, they passed electron beams through a crystal with the Pokkels effect and measured the change in the polarization properties of light falling on it. The study was published in Nature Physics. The Special Theory of Relativity (STO) was an important step taken by Einstein on the way to a modern understanding of the nature of space-time. Her birth was to reconcile the electromagnetic theory of light with the mechanics of fast moving bodies. Michaelson's experiments proved the fallacy of the ether theory, according to which the speed of light could be different in systems moving in a certain direction at a sufficiently high speed. Based on this fact, Einstein postulated the constant of the speed of light. This simple requirement significantly and often simultaneously changes the mechanics of bodies at high speeds, or, as Einstein soon began to say, within the relativistic limit. Later, the great scientist brought this idea to a logical conclusion by linking gravity and the curvature of space-time to the general theory of relativity (GTO). To mark the centenary of the O.T.O., N+1 compiled a collection of popular explanations for the structure of both Einstein's theories in the material \"It's Only a Theory\". Both theories are still being tested with increasing accuracy. This is partly because physicists lack a theory that combines the O.T.O. and quantum field theory. The greatest achievement in this area is the detection of gravitational waves. In general, scientists are focused on testing the OTO, both by astronomical observations and in laboratory conditions. Less effort is devoted to testing relativistic effects that are not directly related to gravity. And if the effects of time shortening or the relationship of energy to the momentum of a relativistic particle began to be tested in physics in the first half of the last century, with every single time confirming the truth of the WTO, the effect of the Cullonian field of compression created by a fast-flying charge has not yet been directly tested. To close this gap, a group of Japanese physicists led by Makoto Nakajima of Osaka University attempted to do so. To do this, they used a relatively fast-moving electron pulse and measured the profile of the electric field it generated. The measurement results were in good agreement with the predictions of special relativity theory and numerical simulations. A resting dot electron creates a field that can be represented as a set of radial power lines that converge evenly in the center of charge. Often the fields are represented through potentials. In this case, the single charge field is visualized through a multitude of equivalence spheres. If the charge starts moving at a speed close to the speed of light, the potential it creates can be represented as a superposition of the multiple spherical electromagnetic potentials it generates as it spreads (described by Liener  Vihert's solutions). The most interesting result of this addition is the direction of the electron's motion. The longer it flies, the greater the radius of curvature at the sum of the equipotential surfaces. Within it is reduced to a plane described by the Lorentz transformations. To measure this field, physicists passed electrons through a film of millimeter thick zinc telluride. The electron pulse, 0.72 picoseconds long, 3.5 millimetres in diameter and a total charge of −70 picoculons, had a Lorentz factor of 69.5, which corresponds to the electron velocity of about 0.9998 light velocities. Zinc telluride demonstrates a strongly expressed Pokkel effect, i.e. the occurrence of a double beam fracture when an electric field is applied. By radiating it simultaneously with the flow of electrons, the authors could use the technique of echeloning the beam to measure the spatial-time voltage profile of the electric field by changing the polarization characteristics of the light. In the first stage, the scientists set up a detection film at a distance of 204 millimeters from the exit titanium window of the electronic gun. The titanium window served as a screen to suppress all previous fields and start the superposition process again. However, at this distance, the pulse field is able to align itself into a plane, which has been confirmed by both experiment and simulation using the particle method in the cells. In the second stage, the authors placed a 15-micrometer-thick aluminum foil between the detector and the electronic gun window at 5, 15 and 25 millimeters. The foil also served to screen electromagnetic fields and allowed to test the fairness of Liener  Vihert's decisions. As in previous experiments, physicists have received satisfactory agreement with theory and simulation. British physicists have previously found that even for single photons, the phase shift in the rotating interferometer (the Saniac effect) occurs exactly as predicted by special relativity."

    "translated_text": "Havas Creative has developed a tablet browser that helps people with trembling hands read. It tracks the movements of the hands and moves the page in the opposite direction to make the image appear motionless. Millions of people around the world suffer from tranquility, a symptom in which the muscles of the body, usually the hands or head, are constantly contracted involuntarily and cause oscillations, such as a strong shaking of the hands. It's most common in Parkinson's disease, and it's present in about 70 percent of patients. When strong, especially when touching the hands, this symptom can greatly reduce the quality of life, making even basic daily activities difficult. For example, people with trembling hands may find it difficult to eat and hold a spoon or fork. The same goes for reading or surfing the web: When you're constantly shaking a book or a gadget, it's hard to focus on the content. The method of stabilizing an image on a screen using an accelerometer was proposed more than a decade ago by American engineers, but they implemented it as a research prototype. Now Havas Creative has introduced a similar Staybl app, but published in the App Store and available to anyone who wants to. It uses the same principle as the electronic stabilization of a smartphone camera. The web page does not cover the entire screen area  the sides display empty fields. The browser constantly monitors the movement of the gadget with an accelerometer and moves the page in the opposite direction to the free fields on the sides. The app can adjust the intensity and sensitivity of the stabilization. Also, because it's hard to press small items in a tremor, all the buttons in the app are made big. The app is currently only available for iPad, but developers plan to add an Android version, though they have yet to announce a date or development date. There are other techniques that can help people with tranquility. For example, we talked about a spoon with a stabilizer and a glove that stabilizes the handbrush itself. Grigory Kopiyev"

    "translated_text": "Biotechnology scientists in Japan have cloned mice from liophilized somatic cells. The results of the experiment were published in Nature Communications. Conserving genetic resources for further cloning is important to maintaining biodiversity. Scientists have successfully cloned several species of animals using nuclear transfer, in which the nuclei of somatic cells (body cells that do not participate in reproduction) are transferred to an egg cell without its own nucleus. This method also cloned Przevalsky's dead horse, and later plans to extend the practice to other species of animals that are disappearing. However, storing genetic material is costly, so researchers are looking for new ways to store and expand the genetic material bank of species. Japanese biotechnologists led by researcher Sayaka Wakayama of Yamamashi University decided to test the possibility of cloning using lyophilized somatic cells. The researchers used fibroblasts (cells of connective tissue) and cumulus cells (cells surrounding ооcit) in mice that lyophilized using trigallose or epigallocatechin. Both types of cells were kept in ampoules at -30 for nine months. The cloning process itself was in nine stages. Before the nuclear transfer procedure, biotechnology engineers had registered the leophilised cells. The analysis showed that the membrane of all the cells was damaged. They then inserted the nucleus of the lyophilized cells into the non-nucleated eggs and activated them. Six hours later, all the embryos formed a pseudo-pronocleus, and the DNA in the cells was damaged. The authors cultivated the cells for 96 hours to study their ability to develop into blastocytes. Injecting them into a mouse's uterus would not have been very successful because of the severe damage, so the researchers took a different path. Removing the glossy shell, they extracted the embryonic stem cells and placed them in a multi-moon tablet with embryonic fibroblasts until they were fully mature, with a success rate of 1018 percent. Then they added demcolcin to the medium to stimulate the metaphase and two hours later transferred the cells to the object glass. Almost all cells had a normal structure and a cariotype. Cloned embryos that have reached the double-celled stage have been introduced into the ovocytes of pseudo-pregnant females by mice first paired with vasectomized males, and then from five to eight embryos are transferred to the horn of the mouse uterus. At 19.5 days after mating, the mice were given offspring by cesarean section. The analysis showed no apparent abnormalities in the reproductive organs of the cloned mice and they were able to produce offspring. The overall success in cloning using lyophilized somatic cells was 0.02 percent, lower than the first cloned animal, Dolly the sheep (0.4 percent). We've written about human cloning progress before. For example, about new ways to clone humans, about genetic editing, and about research ethics. Anastasia Lyashenko"

    "translated_text": "Astronomers have presented the results of their recent discovery of the asteroid Aylohchchinim, whose orbit lies entirely within the orbit of Venus. It turns out that the body is 1.7 kilometers in diameter, it could be classified as a silicate asteroid and in 1-2 million years it could collide with internal planets or even leave the solar system. The article was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Almost all known asteroids today are located in orbits that go beyond Earth's orbit, and only less than one percent of asteroids have orbits that are completely within Earth's orbit. Scientists believe that such bodies migrated from the Main Belt due to gravitational interaction with the planets. Among them, the Atira family, whose members are closer to Earth, and the predicted dynamic models of the Watira family, whose asteroid orbits are entirely within the orbit of Venus, stand out. No such bodies have been observed so far, except for 2020 AV2, as observations of these rare bodies are complicated by their proximity to the Sun and limited by twilight. The asteroid 2020 AV2 was discovered in early 2020 by the ZTF (Zwicky Transient Facility) ground system, at which time scientists were able to estimate its orbit within the orbit of Venus, but data was lacking to describe the body in more detail. In July of this year, the body received the official designation (594913) Aylóchaxnim (Aylohchichnim), which in translation from the indigenous language Luisenyo means \"Venus girl\". A group of astronomers led by Bryce Bolin (Bryce T. Bolin) of the California Institute of Technology published the results of the analysis of the observations of (594913) Aylohchchinim, obtained with the help of the ZTF, SOAR, Magellan Telescopes and the Keck Observatory. The asteroid has a reddish surface, and scientists believe it can be classified as an S-type body, which is consistent with the idea that it originated from the inner core of the Main Belt. The diameter of the asteroid, estimated by albedo and absolute stellar size, is 1.7 ± 0.6 kilometers, its orbit is 0.65 astronomical units from the Sun, and its perihelion  is 0.45 astronomical units from the Sun. The object has been in 3:2 resonance with Venus for the past 60,000 years and will remain in it for another 10,000 years, then leave it and may be in resonance again for 100,000 years. It is expected that the asteroid will remain within the orbit of Venus for another 12 million years, after which its orbit may change due to gravitational interaction with Mercury, Venus or Earth. The body may collide with planets or the Sun or even be ejected outside the Solar System. Thus, (594913) Aylochchinim became the first representative of the family of Watira, which astronomers propose to rename to Aylochchinim. Check if you know the population of the solar system's tiny bodies well by passing the Asteroid Day and Neptune tests. Alexander Voytyk"

    "translated_title": "They found a 30-thousand-year-old burial of a sapion with an amputated leg in Kalimantan.",
    "translated_text": "Archaeologists have discovered the earliest deliberate burial of a human of modern anatomical type (Homo sapiens) on the islands of Southeast Asia. The burial site contains the remains of a 19-20-year-old individual who died more than 30,000 years ago. Moreover, on the bones of his left leg, scientists have found evidence of successful surgical amputation, performed at least six years before a person died. This is the oldest known case of a limb removal by surgical means. This is reported in an article published in the journal Nature. Amputation is one of the oldest surgical procedures. In historical times, it could be used as a medical procedure, performed as part of a ritual, or as a physical punishment for a crime. Also, the Hammurabi Laws provided for cutting off the handbrush for a poorly performed surgery by a physician. The images on the walls of the temple of Ramesses III in Egypt show the number of prisoners of war being counted by the number of hands cut off. In addition, in ancient China, the practice of punishing offenders by amputating limbs was already in place as early as the first millennium B.C.E. The question of when amputation began for medical purposes remains open. Thus, the earliest written references to self-amputation and limb dissection as a medical procedure are found in the works of Hippocrates. However, much older examples from the archaeological record are also known. Some researchers cite the remains of an elderly Neanderthal (H. Neanderthalensis) Shanidar-I, who lacked part of his right hand. But it's not clear how this individual lost his limb. Surgical amputation probably existed in the Neolithic era. The remains of an elderly man found at the Boutière-Bulancourt monument near Paris are proof of this. This individual, who lived about 4900-4700 B.C., had his left arm amputated. And he appears to have survived the operation, which suggests he's recovered. Tim Ryan Maloney of Griffith University, along with colleagues from Australia, Indonesia and South Africa, has been studying the remains of an adult. The burial of this individual was discovered by archaeologists during excavations of the Liang-Tebo Cave, located in the east of Kalimantan. The monument also contains numerous evidence of prehistoric human activity, including a rock painting dating back at least 40,000 years. Scientists noted that the individual was buried lying on his back with his legs bent. So, his right knee was pressed against his chest. Along with the remains, archaeologists also found stone artifacts, as well as a 22×17-millimeter piece of red watch that was located near the lower jaw of the human skull. An anthropological study has shown that the skeleton is well preserved  about 75 percent of the bones and all teeth are present. The morphological characteristics of the individual led to the conclusion that he was a modern anatomical type of man (H. The species is known to be a sapiens (Sapiens) of about 1920 years, but scientists have not been able to determine its sex. But this man was similar in height to other men in Asia who lived until the last ice age. For radiocarbon analysis, archaeologists collected several samples of charcoal, and also dated one of the teeth using uranium series and electronic back resonance. After re-calibrating the results, they concluded that the individual died about 3120130714 years ago. According to researchers, it is the earliest known deliberate burial of a modern-looking human found on the islands of Southeast Asia. During excavations, archaeologists found that the individual had no bones in his left foot, while all the bones in his right foot were in the burial ground. An anthropological study has shown that there are signs of surgical amputation on the left and right bones of the greater and lesser vertebrae, and signs of healing are visible on both bones. Researchers estimate that the man lived at least six to nine years after the operation. Moreover, there is no indication that the infection developed after the amputation. Because the left bone of the greater and lesser vertebrae was noticeably smaller in length, scientists thought the operation was performed in childhood. The scientists noted that the late plaistocene \"surgeon\" who amputated the man's left leg had to have good knowledge of anatomy to avoid death from blood loss or infection. The discovery of this ancient evidence of intentional amputation, according to the researchers, demonstrates a high level of medical knowledge among people living in the tropical forests of Sunda in the Stone Age. Previously on N+1, they told us about other operations done in ancient times. For example, paleopathologists have discovered in Spain the remains of an elderly woman who had undergone a mastoidotomy in the fourth millennium BC. In addition, scientists have identified the largest bronze age skull trepanation in the Crimean steppe. My father is a police officer ."

    "translated_title": "Physicists have gotten a water analogue of surface plasmon-polariton",
    "translated_text": "Chinese physicists have demonstrated the excitation of a water analog of a one-way surface plasma-polariton. The role of dielectric is played by water in a shallow pool, and the role of metal is played by water near a metamaterial, a 3D printed plastic wall with a beam. The experiment confirmed that with the right parameters, the water waves only spread in one direction near the surface of the wall. The study was published in Physical Review Letters. The first wave of human activity was the fluctuations of the water surface. Over time, people realized that waves can have many physical properties: sound, light, deformation, as well as heat, particles, and gravity. Strangely enough, the best man has ever done is subject to electromagnetic waves. Not only have we learned to distort their wavefront by turning the convex wave into the divergent wavefront with the lens, but we also have learned to manipulate their phase with metamaterials and metaperials. The latter made it possible to make objects invisible, to negatively break light and to violate the law of rotation of light rays. The advances in the creation of unusual optical materials have spurred similar research in other wave areas of physics. So, we've already talked about how physicists have done a negative breakdown for sound and electrons. A similar effect was observed for waves on the surface of water. In the case of water, wave propagation control is important for navigation and environmental protection, so scientists are actively looking for water-like analogues of optical metamaterials. In this search, Huanyang Chen and colleagues at Shandong University have developed a structure that shows the water equivalent of a one-way surface plasma-polariton. Surface plasma-polaritons are hybrid excitations that occur at the metal-dielectric boundary under the influence of light. They can be imagined as the constant conversion of electromagnetic waves in dielectricity (polaritons) into charging waves in metal (plasms) and vice versa. The peculiarity of the plasma polaritons was that they were located in a very narrow surface layer many times smaller than the wavelength. This makes them a useful tool for subwave microscopy. To reproduce a similar effect for water, physicists needed the equivalent of dielectric and metal. First, they noticed that the equations of small water (i.e., for water with a small depth) are equivalent to the equations for the transverse magnetic (TM) components of an electromagnetic field. At this point, the pressure on the surface of the water can be adjusted to the magnetic field voltage, and the magnetic induction can be adjusted to its vertical shift. Thus, water of a shallow depth can act as a dielectric. The metal has a negative rate of breakdown. In the language of water waves, the refractive index corresponds to the depth. It turns out that the effect of negative depth can be obtained by causing the surface wave to diffract across an array of grains of grains that are applied to the wall and resemble a diffraction lattice. Analytical and numerical calculations have shown that this effect occurs only for certain geometrical ratios of the edges and distances from the source of the wave to the wall. Finally, surface plasma polyatons have another interesting property. They become strictly one-way if the light that excites them has circular polarization. In this case, the direction of the plasma-polariton motion is determined by the direction of rotation of the polarisation plane. In a water analogue, the role of light with circular polarization is played by waves twisted around a circle. Calculations showed that in this case, the surface wave propagates in only one direction, tightly clinging to the boundary. Physicists tested their calculations with experiments. They poured water into a small pool, leaving a depth of about two inches [1.5 cm]. One of the pool walls was printed on a PLA plastic 3D printer. It contained a period of 0.909 centimetres, an interval of 0.455 centimetres and a depth of 0.773 centimetres. The authors have laid soft sponges on the other walls of the pool to suppress reflection. The researchers used a small screw to create circular waves of about five centimeters in the pool. They found that when the distance from the screw to the wall is 0.2 wavelengths (1 centimeter), surface waves exist only on one side. They put a pair of light balls on each side of the water to make it more visible. The balls, propelled by water-plasmon-polyritons, moved toward the wall, while the opposite pair barely moved. Waves of water can be the equivalent not only to optical effects but also to gravitational effects. We've written about how physicists used them to study the interaction of a black hole with an external field. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "The manuscript of Galileo Galilei was a forgery",
    "translated_text": "American historian Nick Wilding has discovered that Galileo Galilei's manuscript from the University of Michigan library is a forgery. It was supposedly made by the famous forger Tobias Nicotra in the 1930s. This is reported in a press release from the University of Michigan. For nearly a century, the University of Michigan library has kept a one-page document that was credited to the famous Italian physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei. It was first known in 1934 when artifacts collected by a wealthy collector of manuscripts and ancient books were put up for auction. It was then stated that the authenticity of Galileo's manuscript was established by the Italian cardinal and archbishop of Pisa, Pietro Maffi, who lived from 1858 to 1931. In 1938, it was donated to the University of Michigan. The text of this manuscript consists of two parts. The first, named after Galileo, tells the Venetian Doge of a newly built telescope. The second contains observations of Jupiter and its satellites. The original letter to the dog is kept in the State Archives of Venice. American historian Nick Wilding of the University of Georgia, who came to prominence after exposing a fake copy of Galileo Galilei's \"Cidery of the Nuncio\", was working on a new book on Italian physics. He was interested in a draft of a letter from a scientist who is kept in the library of the University of Michigan, so he wrote to Pablo Alvarez, the curator of the institution, expressing doubts about the authenticity of the document. Wilding noted that the watermark on the paper contains monograms of its manufacturer  \"AS\" and manufacturing site  \"BMO\". The last monogram denotes the Italian city of Bergamo, but no other documents with such a watermark, written before 1770 (Galileo died in 1642) are known to scientists. The historian concludes that the Galilei manuscript is a forgery of the 20th century (approximately 1930s), created by the supposedly famous forger Tobias Nicotra. An independent review by the University of Michigan confirmed Wilding's conclusion. Last year we were talking about another fake historical document. Then Yale University scientists proved that the map of Vinland, which is considered the oldest map of America, was a forgery made in the 20th century. My father is a police officer ."

The maneuver will allow the spacecraft to reach several Jupiter Trojans and one Main Belt asteroid, Nasaspaceflight reports. I'm not going to. Lucy was launched into space last year, becoming the first project to explore Trojans asteroids that haven't yet been visited by spacecraft. The station will visit 8 Trojans from Jupiter and one from the Main Belt over 12 years, taking detailed images of them and determining their properties and composition. On the morning of October 16, 2022, Lucy successfully performed the first gravitational maneuver near Earth, which increased the station's rotation period around the Sun and changed its orbit, sending the station to the L4 point of the Jupiter  Sun system. During its approach to Earth, Lucy was 351 kilometers from the planet's surface, below the orbit of the ISS and near-Earth telescopes, and it was necessary to compensate for the slight resistance of the atmosphere that the apparatus was experiencing. The minimum flight altitude was increased from the original value, and a few hours before that, the station performed a corrective maneuver, which prevented problems with the unattached solar battery and collisions with space debris.

    "translated_title": "The quantum computer has been running information through a cortical notch.",
    "translated_text": "American physicists have performed the first ever simulation of information passing through a holographic cutoff, performed on a quantum computer. The study was the first step toward a laboratory study of the effects of quantum gravity using only quantum systems. It was published in Nature, and briefly recounted by Adam Brown and Leonard Susskind in the editorial of the same issue. To build a theory of everything is a dream of physicists. Today, they've already been able to combine three of the four fundamental interactions. The last step on this path  is to link quantum theory to gravity  has been quite complex and unfinished. Although quantum gravity has not yet been constructed, scientists know many of the properties it must possess. Many theorists believe that a new theory must be based on the holographic principle. This is called the ability to represent all objects existing in some N-dimensional space by using an N-1-dimensional display on its boundary. This is how holograms work: a three-dimensional image of an object is formed by a two-dimensional pattern. In the case of the theory of unity, the holographic principle proposes to consider the quantum field theory given in space-time dimension 3+1 (three spatial and one time dimension), the hologram of quantum gravity given in space-time anti-de Sitter dimension 4+1. This connection is called ADC/CTF conformity or holographic duality. Read more about this hypothesis in our previous news stories (1, 2). In 2015, Alexei Kitaev found a simple configuration in the fermion system, now called the Sachdev  Ye  Kitaev model (SYK), which demonstrates a clear holographic duality, meaning its dynamics look like a shadow of quantum gravitational dynamics in larger space. Later, Gao and Jafferis proposed a protocol that would allow the effect of transmitting information through a cortical node to be seen by interlacing two SYK subsystems. For the first time, a group of American physicists led by Maria Spiropulu of the California Institute of Technology observed this effect in a real quantum system. The team was working with the Sycamore quantum computer, which is owned by Google. Scientists were able to find conditions in which a computer simulated the effect of information passing through a thin hole using just nine cubits. In the selected approach, the two SYK subsystems are dual to the outer areas of two black holes connected by a crotal notch (although these objects are called wormholes). According to Gao and Jafferis' calculations, wormholes can be created by the impact waves of negative energy. In the context of the holographic approach, this corresponds to some interaction between subsystems with a negative connection constant μ. In the first phase, the authors conducted simulations on ordinary computers. They asked for two sets of Majoron fermions that evolved freely until some point in time when physicists included a shock wave interaction between them. The sign of teleportation was the measure of the amount of information entropy of states is given over time. At first, the simulation was scrambling information, and the information was decreasing, but at some point, it was peaking, corresponding to the information recovery at the other end of the cortex. The mathematical complexity of the SYK subsystems was on the way to implementing this scheme on a quantum device. The analysis showed that the minimum number of subsystems needed to implement the protocol is 10, and the number of connections between them (members in the hamilton) is  210. The number of qubits needed to encode such a system was too large. To solve this problem, the team tried to perform a hamiltonan cleavage procedure, which is to reduce the number of subsystems and the connections between them while maintaining the main sign of the corneal nerve  recovering information at the other end. They used machine learning to do that. The dataset was based on the time-dependence of the information measure, built for ideal conditions. Each new dilution interaction was evaluated using a loss function that characterizes the closeness of the information measure to the ideal. Optimization of gradient descent methods has reduced the number of subsystems to seven, and the number of members in the hamiltonian  to five without significant deviations from the full picture. Finally, physicists applied their findings to a real quantum computer. To achieve these conditions, they had nine qubits that could be provided by the Sycamore superconducting quantum computer. By executing the protocol built on it, the authors saw the effect of gravitational teleportation of information, but the result was achieved within the limits of accuracy due to the depolarizing noises being introduced by quantum valves, the number of which reached several hundred. Further analysis showed that if the error was one and a half times greater, the effect would be no different from zero. Scientists have determined that the teleportation is gravitational. In addition to the correct dimensional properties and critical role of negative energy, the Shapiro effect and the causation of the two signals were also evidence of this. All of this suggests that the effect is related to the dynamics of the passing coronary arteries. I would like to emphasize that the work is a holographic simulation. This means that the gravitational effects that physicists have investigated are of an extremely urgent nature, and there was no real space-time curvature in the experiment, so there's no need to worry that Sycamore will create a black hole. And what's more, nine qubits are easily simulated by classical computers, so formally, this new study doesn't give us anything new that we don't know about quantum gravity. Despite this, Spiropoulou and her colleagues' work is a major milestone in the early days of quantum gravity research in the laboratory. Given the rapid growth in quantum computing, we can expect really new results in the near future. Not only quantum computers but also quantum simulators can mimic gravitational effects. We recently talked about how physicists modeled the expansion of the universe using a Bose-Condensate."

    "translated_title": "Physicists have learned to determine the preparation of the dough by its fusion.",
    "translated_text": "American physicists have linked the fusion of two parallel-hanging cylindrical plates to the degree of their preparedness, expressed by the distribution of water and their mechanical properties. To do this, they had to build a detailed model of the diffusion of water inside the starch, and also link its concentration to the elasticity of the swollen larvae. The results showed good agreement with the experiment. The study was published in Physics of Fluids. pasta products are of interest to physicists not only as a dish, but also as objects that allow us to see many interesting mechanical, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic phenomena. The complexity of the mechanical waves that travel through the dry, thin pasta, which makes it impossible to break it in two, and the elasticity of the pasta with its boiling in water and heating. Research in this area has allowed us to build the first models of softening spaghetti when baked and even learn to program the shape of the finished paste. Such studies have a clear practical significance: models developed using affordable and cheap pasta can help better predict the behavior of materials that swell and soften like starch. It's also useful for industrial cooking, because the deformation of pasta can be a measure of their readiness. On the other hand, the mechanical properties of spaghetti or lapis also determine the balance between elasticity and capillary forces when they are fused. It's easy to see that by just pouring spaghetti with a fork. A group of physicists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign decided to establish this connection more thoroughly after studying how different boiling regimes affect the flavor. They conducted a series of experiments that followed two distilled water-baked cloves hanging next to each other for a short distance. This is because of the formation of the meniscus when they are pulled out of the water. The folded patches resemble the letter Y, and the authors wondered what exactly determines the position of the folding point. To answer this question, scientists have explored the processes of diffusion of water into the starch matrix, with the resulting swelling and softening of the pasta. The difficulty was that the swelling of the cylindrical plate was uneven: water accumulated primarily at its edges, while the core could remain hard. To get a clear picture of this process, physicists wrote down Fick's second law in a cylindrical coordinate system for the diffusion coefficient of water molecules depending on their concentration. The solution to this equation allowed them to draw a conclusion about the length of the length of the cube over time, which the authors also tested using a linear equation. This comparison not only showed the fairness of the calculations, but also allowed us to know the exact parameters for the solutions. However, to answer the main question, it was necessary to understand how swelling affects the curved stiffness of the lip. The unevenness of swelling also complicates the process, which is why physicists had to break up a macaroni cylinder into 50 so-axis subcylinders to build a numerical model. To connect the model's parameters to reality, the authors measured the modulus of elasticity of the patches by stretching them using a laboratory dynamic mechanical analyzer. The analysis showed that their Jung module decreases over time by four orders of magnitude according to a fairly non-trivial law. Physicists have identified three states of the -lapshins from the glass-like through the intermediate to the rubber-like. The latter is characterized by the water saturation of the lip, including the heart. Finally, physicists were able to compare the height of the folding and the degree of preparation of the pasta, expressed through knowledge of their water saturation and mechanical resistance to rupture (presumably, teeth). Scientists have found that boiling at 100 degrees Celsius is much faster than boiling at 80 degrees. However, the influence of the cooking salt was unexpected: modeling showed that adding it accelerates the diffusion of water molecules into the starch matrix, and also increases the Jung flavor module by two orders of magnitude compared to boiling in distilled water. The authors hope that their work will help them find the best possible conditions for making the most delicious pastries and will also be a good experiment for learning mechanics. Using food to study physics is not a new idea. We've already told you how waffles with caramel in chocolate glaze have been a tool for students to learn composite materials. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "Crown discharges outnumbered thunder clouds in the number of radicalized oxidizers created",
    "translated_text": "Scientists in the United States have discovered that during thunderstorms, the crown discharges of ground-based objects create a huge amount of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals and ozone. The hydroxyl radicals thus formed can have a positive effect on the climate by neutralizing greenhouse methane, and a negative effect on the electricity transmission line by destroying their polymer insulators. The work was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Hydroxyl radicals (HO•)  are one of the main oxidizers in the atmosphere. Despite their high reactive capacity in the air, their half-life is tens of milliseconds, so these particles play an important role in the oxidation processes of the atmosphere (in particular, they neutralize greenhouse gases). It is therefore important to understand the conditions under which and in what quantities they form. Scientists have recently discovered that a large number of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO•) are produced in the atmosphere by lightning and other weaker electrical discharges. Another potential source of radicals may be the crown discharges that occur during the storm, but no estimate has been made of the number of radicals in this case. To determine the concentrations of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals that arise from coronal discharges on ground conductors, a group of scientists led by William H. Brune, of the University of Pennsylvania, analyzed data from atmospheric observations. Scientists have also experimentally assessed how these particles affect the oxidation of materials near the crown. For the analysis, the physicists used data obtained by the tropospheric hydrogen oxide sensor in Houston from August to September 2006 and April 2009. During the thunderstorm, scientists observed a sharp increase in the signal, which was 23 times higher than typical daytime peak values. The concentrations of both radicals ranged from 2.3 × 109 to 4.6 × 1010 particles  even greater than those in thunderclouds. To prove that the radiation excess on the sensor was caused by a thunderstorm corona discharge, scientists first artificially generated the same discharge. The radicality concentration measured by the sensor matched the atmospheric measurements and was proportional to the voltage of the electric field. And the concentration of ozone that formed was 2432 times greater than the concentration of each radical. The same ratio of concentrations that physicists observed in thunder clouds a few years ago. For a crown discharge on grounded thunderstorms, the number of radicals is comparable to the results for a sensor, and it's easier to charge them than it is to a sensor. So physicists suggested that grounded metal objects in buildings also increase the concentration of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals during thunderstorms. In the second part of the work, physicists quantified the impact of corona-induced radicals on the surrounding conductors and thunderstorms in the United States. They estimated that there are about 50 thunderstorms in the southern and central U.S. cities a year. And the total duration of the crown ratings is one hour a year. Then the oxidation rate of the air within 10 centimeters of the thunderstorms is 10 times the normal. Scientists estimate that radiation levels, given their windward movement, can increase by 10 to 100 times at a distance of up to 10 meters from the LEP. The authors also found that oxidation by OH-radicals causes the breakdown of hydrocarbon bonds in polymers used for PE insulators. The effects of OH-radicals are more damaging than ozone because of their high reactive capacity. Previously, the main cause of degradation of polymers at the crown discharge was the exposure of ultraviolet radiation from high-density particles. Scientists have concluded that the large number of hydroxyl radicals that form from crown discharges on ground metal surfaces during thunderstorms may be a key cause of degradation of the LEP insulators. At the same time, hydroxyl radicals neutralize greenhouse gases, and they can have a positive climate effect. The next step, scientists say, could be to improve numerical estimates: counting the crown displays on city-owned metal structures, not just thunderstorms, adding wind corrections and calculating the number of OH-radicals in lightning. Hydroxyl radicals can occur not only because of coronal discharges, but even because of ozone ozone around human skin. And scientists have found a way to keep the metal from oxidizing by a hydroxyl group. The Elderly"

    "translated_title": "Prolonged drought has led to social tensions and the collapse of Mayyapane",
    "translated_text": "The researchers conducted an interdisciplinary study of materials from the city of Mayyapán, the largest political capital of the Maya post-classical period. They found that while the rainfall in the region remained at a sufficient level, the city's population continued to grow. But prolonged droughts have led to increased social tensions and violence. Mayyapán was eventually abandoned in the mid-15th century. It is noteworthy that researchers seem to have found a mass grave of the Kokomov dynasty, who were killed in the uprising of about 1441. This is reported in an article published in Nature Communications. At the turn of the first and second millennia of our era, the classical Maya society was in crisis. Many territories were virtually depopulated, governmental associations disintegrated, many cities disappeared, and social structures and economies were destroyed. Some scientists see climate change as the cause of this process, while others argue that the internal structural problems in Maya society are the culprit. In the early postclassical period, around the second half of the X mid-11th century, the city of Chichen-Iza flourished, which controlled much of northern Yucatán. However, soon it and several other cities fell into decay, and Mayapan established dominion over the peninsula in the late XII century. Mayapan is the largest political capital of the Maya of the post-classical period. It was inhabited from about 1100 to 1450 and surpassed the size of any city in the Maya lowlands of Belize, Guatemala, and Mexico, serving as a center of political, economic, and religious life. From the second half of the XIII century, Mayyapán was ruled by the Kokomov dynasty, whose power was largely based on control over trade with other regions. However, in 1441 the Kokoma were overthrown in a revolt led by the Shio dynasty, and the Yucatán, as a result, split into a dozen rival states but closely linked trade. Today, Mayapan is the ruins of an ancient city. Archaeologists have discovered remains of the city wall, several thousand buildings, including monumental temples, a sacred sanctuary (a natural well), numerous art objects, burials, and other things related to the Maya civilization. Douglas Kennett of the University of California, Santa Barbara, together with colleagues from Australia, Britain, Germany, Canada, Mexico, and the United States, combined archaeological, historical, osteological, and paleoclimatic data to test the link between climate change, civil conflicts, and the political collapse of Mayapan in the 14th and 15th centuries. Scientists also conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the remains of 205 people to confirm or refute information from written sources about a number of landmark events in Mayapan history recorded using the Maya calendar: from the period of \"terror and war\" (13021323) to the assassination of representatives of the Kokom dynasty (14401461), as well as political decline and abandonment of the city (after 1450). To determine the climate conditions of the Maya during the study period, scientists analyzed stable oxygen isotopes in the speleotems and also studied changes in the salinity of water in a small lake about 27 kilometers from Mayapan. As a result of this work, scientists found that about 11001340 years ago, the region experienced a fair amount of rainfall. This was accompanied by a population growth that peaked at about 12001350 years, after which the population began to decline, reaching a minimum level of about 1450. This conclusion is confirmed by written sources. Radiocarbon analysis of the remains from a collective burial excavated near the temple showed that 25 individuals died around 13021362. Three of them had brain injuries, cuts to the bones, and deliberate contamination. According to the researchers, this burial may match historical evidence of the Yucatan conflict (possibly the victims of the war). Another type of collective burial is two 1360-1400-year-old objects excavated near ceremonial structures, which contained contaminated human remains with ritual ceramics. A number of remains show that people died by violent deaths (stone knives wounded different parts of the skeleton), in addition, some remains were dismembered and burned. According to scientists, this is consistent with historical data on the struggle within the ruling groups. It is noteworthy that this event coincided with a major drought in central Mexico. Historical evidence of mass killings in Mayyapane also matches data on population reduction and construction of architectural structures. Another collective burial was found near the Temple of Kuculcan. Scientists have suggested that it may correspond to the burial of the Kokomov dynasty of Shi'ites. The skull and bones of the postcranial skeleton belonged to at least nine individuals, seven of whom were children. Two people have been found with traces of bruises. According to radio carbon analysis, this event occurred between 1440 and 1460. Moreover, paleogenetic analysis confirmed that the buried were genetically related to each other in the maternal line. The researchers concluded that in Mayyapane, the population decline coincided with the period of extreme drought (about 13501430 years). As a result, famine followed, trade was disrupted and Mayyapán was eventually abandoned, and its inhabitants established many small states throughout Yucatán. Scientists also concluded that the prolonged difficulties caused by climate change have led to social tensions fueled by politicians. This eventually led to a repeated increase in violence. They also confirmed written records of the city's decline between 1441 and 1461. Previously on N+1, they were talking about other studies on the Maya. For example, archaeologists have discovered a lost city in Yucatan with a puck-style architecture. And paleogenetics have found that migrants from the south were the ancestors of the Maya.

    "translated_title": "The stormtroopers hid from the strong wind in the eye of the storm",
    "translated_text": "The storm-watching windmen from the Japanese island of Avashima escape storms and typhoons by hiding in the eye of the storm, where wind speeds are not high. This is what ornithologists have come to after analyzing the movements of 75 species marked with GPS transmitters. For comparison, most seabirds try to fly a tropical cyclone or wait for it on the shore. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Tropical cyclones, including Atlantic hurricanes and Pacific typhoons, pose a serious threat to seabirds. Sometimes strong winds kill thousands and even tens of thousands of birds. To avoid becoming a natural disaster, adult seabirds try to stay away from the most intense areas of cyclones. For example, red-legged bullies (Sula sula) and large frigates (Fregata minor) move 400-600 kilometers away from normal hunting grounds during a hurricane or typhoon. Light-colored bats (Sterna sumatrana) also fly away from tropical cyclones approaching their colonies, but do not always respond to them during migrations. A team of ornithologists led by Emily Sheppard (Emily L. C. Shepard, a researcher at Swansea University, decided to learn more about how seabirds survive the elements. The researchers focused on the wild boar (Calonectris leucomelas) from the Japanese colony on the Japanese island of Avashima off the west coast of Honshu. Typhoon activity in this part of the Pacific is particularly high. In 2008-2018, Sheppard and her colleagues provided 401 storm surge GPS navigators, and then analyzed their movements. It turned out that 75 of the marked individuals encountered a total of ten tropical cyclones or storms. Even in areas with winds of up to 100 feet per second, birds continued to fly. They were driven by strong lateral winds, which is typical of their usual style of dynamic mating based on the difference in wind speed at different heights. At the next stage, the researchers tried to figure out how the storm surgeons adjust the direction of motion relative to the eye of the storm  of the clearing region and the relative calm weather in the center of a tropical cyclone with a diameter of 20-50 kilometers. To do that, they analyzed two sets of data. The first included the movement of all 75 birds during all ten cyclones and storms, and the second only included 55 individuals who encountered two of the strongest storms and three typhoons. In both cases, the authors have identified a link between wind speed and the direction of the storm surge. At wind speeds of more than ten meters per second, birds flew toward the eye of the storm, and if it was less than ten meters per second, then away from it. In addition, stormwatches were more often directed at the eye of the storm with strong south winds and less often  with strong north or east winds. At the same time, individuals caught by a storm or typhoon off the coast of Honshu try to wait for the weather in the face of the storm, and their relatives who encounter the cyclone in the open sea fly it. This indicates that birds are important for their position relative to the cyclone and shore. Further analysis showed that the stormy beetles fly into the center of cyclones that travel 60 to 170 kilometers from the birds' main feeding grounds. Some of the storm signers were watching the storm for hours. For example, one person spent more than four hours alongside the center of Typhoon Talim, and two others spent more than eight hours pursuing the center of Typhoon Simaron. The results of the study show that the storm-watching storm-watching birds survive storms and typhoons in the face of storms (unlike most seabirds who try to fly a tropical cyclone or wait for it on the shore). (I 'm not sure . However, to get there, they have to cross very strong winds, as wind speeds increase as the eye of the storm moves to the outer edge and then fall. Because avasima stormy beetles are more likely to be directed into the eye of the storm when the southern winds blow and when they are near the shore, the authors suggest that birds trapped between the cyclone and the coast avoid the strong winds that occur off the coast of Honshu after a tropical cyclone passes in a northern direction. At the same time, individuals caught by a storm in the open sea can fly it. Thus, storm surgeons react flexibly to the approach of the elements depending on their position relative to the cyclone and the coast. We've talked about how American physicists built a mathematical model of a flying squirrel and tested its stability in the tank. It turned out that most configurations that can take the wing of a gull and its body relative to the horizon line are stable, but for a quick maneuver the gull must choose unstable flight modes.

    "translated_title": "Long migrations have upset family ties",
    "translated_text": "Ornithologists have found that couples are more likely to break up in birds that migrate far away. This is likely because males and females of the same species often return to their nesting sites at different times. If a bird waits for last year's partner, it risks missing the breeding season. To avoid that, she has to find a new partner. In addition, the proportion of polygamous males has a positive effect on the frequency of breakups. The research paper is published on bioRxiv. Many birds are monogamous, meaning that during one breeding season they only produce offspring with one partner. In some cases, such couples may last for several years or even for life. However, even the most loyal birds occasionally abandon their old partners and find new ones. For example, pairs of black albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) are more likely to break down if their last breeding season together was unsuccessful due to the high water temperature in the sea. Stray albatross (Diomedea exulans) also occasionally break up with their partners. However, shy males are more likely to differ from females than are more courageous and risk-taking relatives. A team of ornithologists led by Yang Liu of Sun Yat-sen University decided to learn more about what factors influence the frequency of breaks in birds. Researchers suggested that in monogamous species, which have a significant proportion of polygamous individuals, long migrations, or high mortality rates, couples break up more often. To test these hypotheses, they collected and analyzed data on 232 primarily monogamous species of birds from 61 families and 25 breeds. In addition to the features of breeding, migration, and mortality, the authors took into account evolutionary connections and the distribution of all species included in the sample. Analysis showed that the proportion of polygamous males correlates positively with the frequency of breakups in monogamous species (p&lt;0,001). In other words, the more polygamists among the male members of a particular species of bird, the more likely that the family pairs of this species will break up. The proportion of polygamous females does not affect the likelihood of breaking up. In addition, as Liu and his colleagues expected, species migrating over long distances are more likely to part with their partners (p &lt; 0,05). However, the third hypothesis of the authors has not been confirmed: the mortality rate does not directly affect the frequency of breakups. Researchers suggest that because female birds spend more time breeding, they choose a pair more carefully than males do, and they prefer to maintain old family ties rather than change partners. Thus, even in species with a high proportion of polygamous females, females are less likely to initiate breakup. However, some studies suggest that female birds at least sometimes have a good relationship break-up, which is contrary to this explanation. The connection between long-distance migration and the frequency of disengagement is easier to explain. According to Liu and his co-authors, the longer the flight of a particular species of bird, the more likely it is that the male and female of the same pair will return to their nesting sites at different times. If a bird waits too long for last year's partner, it risks missing the breeding season. To avoid that, she has to find a new partner. In addition, among the long-distance migrants, the proportion of polygamous males is higher. Thus, long-distance migration can affect the frequency of breakups not only directly but also through the increased propensity of males to promiscuity. The results of the study show that family pairs of birds are disintegrating not only because of their own decisions, but also because of objective environmental factors. This should be taken into account when assessing the adaptability of such behavior. We've been telling you before that migratory birds are, on average, lighter than the seated ones. This is the conclusion of a team of ornithologists who analyzed data on migration strategies and the flowering of nearly ten thousand species of birds. Perhaps the bright color helps the migratory birds to stay warm while traveling, reflecting some of the sun's rays."

From the texts in the tomb, scientists learned that the Uāhibra-Mārineite, who lived in the In this difficult time for Egypt, he commanded mercenaries, and judging by the The unfinished state of the tomb, his death came suddenly. The find is reported in the press release of the Czech Institute Egyptology, and also tells the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities on its I'm going to a Facebook page. The Late Period The history of ancient Egypt is marked by frequent and heavy wars, as well as the rise of the It's the instability of the inner world. After the Assyrian invasion ended, the successful The unification of the country by the first pharaohs of the XXVI (Sais) dynasty and the cultural The rise of the late 7th  early 6th century BC Egypt entered an era of decline. Weakening of central power, internal turmoil and foreign policy The civil war that broke out in 570 BC It was first described by Herodotus in his second book, Histories. The cause of the war was internal conflict. the army between the Egyptian warriors and the Greek mercenaries whom he favored. The king. Apri suffered defeat, but his successor Amasius (Yachmos II) continued the benevolent The Greek government was also involved in the political process of the Greeks, who were increasingly entering Egypt. When This ruler, whom Herodotus calls \"the friend of the Hellenists\", contacts Egypt with the The Greek army became particularly strong, and the mercenary army, which was equipped with The army was made up of mostly Greek soldiers. But it couldn't. to resist the Persian armies that soon after Amassis' death, in 525 In the year B.C., they invaded Egypt under the command of King Cambyses II, He also actively used Greek mercenaries. The Cruelty of the People The conquest of Egypt by Cambyses II, is described in detail by Herodotus in his third book, History. It is known that During the time of Persian rule, which historians after Manetho attribute to a separate, XXVII dynasty, the Egyptians repeatedly staged uprisings. So, shortly after the Cambys invasion, a disorder broke out, which The power was briefly seized by a noble Egyptian of royal blood named Padibaste (in Greek reading  Petubast). It is not excluded that The rebels led by Petubast managed to ambush and destroy the Persian A force sent to attack the famous temple of Amun in The oasis of Siva. King Darius I (522486 BC) led Egypt to the The government was not so submissive, but later pursued a much more soft policy and The Egyptian satrapy management relied heavily on local The clergy and the priesthood. However, in the last years of his reign, Shadowed by the failure of the Greek campaign, Egypt rose again. Apparently, in The head of the rebellion was a man mentioned in the documents. The time of the Pharaoh of Psalms IV. After the uprising, Darius Xerxes succeeded. I no longer showed the fatherly tenderness, and with him the Egyptians, apparently, were not admitted to publicly important posts. However, before The Kserks were a local nobility with a chance to take a high position, and the The time of turmoil and being in command of the army. This is evidenced by the discovery of Czech archaeologists in 2021 in the The Abusir necropolis, which is located about 20 kilometers southwest of Cairo, adjacent to Saqqara, and was once part of the vast city of Memphis The necropolis. Here scientists have made a unique discovery  the secret of the late XXVI  the beginning of the XXVII dynasty, that is, the time at the turn of the VIV century BC, when In Egypt, which had weakened but not ceased to resist, the Persian Empire was established. The Lord. The vault was filled with 370 large ceramic items . vessels with residues of materials used in embalming, Unused canopies  containers for storing intestines  and a number of smaller ones The artifacts. The canopies were signed by a certain Uhira-Mereenite, the son of Mrs. I'm going to go. Judging by the size of this treasure, it belonged to a very wealthy and a high ranking man. In the 2022 season year of archaeologists from the Czech Institute of Egyptology at the Faculty of Arts The Carlov University in Prague under the leadership of Miroslav Bárta, leading excavations in Abusyr already Many years ago, we found the tomb of Mr. Wahibra-Mereenite. She represents typical of the Late Period, but differs from the more complex The device and the size. Very wide main shaft of square cross section from 14 meters on the side, it goes down to a depth of six meters. The bottom of this mine The central part of the building is divided into several sections. The entrance to the second shaft is surrounded by a fence of raw brick with a section It's about 6.5x3.3 meters, going down to a depth of 16 meters. The sarcophagus, Standing at the bottom of this deep mine and oriented along the axis East to west, it was double. The outside of it was made of two The massive blocks of white limestone. The inner anthropomorphic sarcophagus of length 2,3 meters wide and 1,98 meters wide , made of basalt and covered with text from chapter 72 \"Speech of the Daylight\", widely known as \"The Book of the Dead\". This chapter contains spells that should help the deceased to overcome a dangerous path in A region of the afterlife called Imhet, where the god of death rules. A shark responsible for the proper transition to a crawling existence. The grave It was looted in ancient times, probably in the 4th-5th centuries AD. This is evidenced by two Coptic vessels, which were forgotten by robbers in the main The mine. Graveyard thieves drilled a hole in the outer sarcophagus with the west side The sides and the front part of the inner sarcophagus were torn to pieces. Archaeologists found these wrecks nearby, on the sandy bottom of a burial pit. In the very Only two amulets were found in the sarcophagus. One of them is the so-called \"heart scarab\", which, when the mummy was being painted, lay over the heart, to silence him if he wants to testify against him. The one who died at Osiris' court. The second amulet is a subheading for I'm not going to tell you. According to the Egyptians, he helped the spirit of a deceased person in another world. The human world is to keep a clear mind. In the title and The sarcophagus was found to be worn out by the burial equipment left behind. The robbery of the cemetery. There were two wooden boxes containing 402. and the shapes of the pine-tree, and ten vessels for incense, and two canopies of wood, The travertine (\"Egyptian alebaster\") without inscriptions, a fancy model of a table for The funeral services and the limestone obituary with short excerpts from the Book The dead\". Name of the place The man buried here, Uhira-Mereenite, is known from inscriptions. He was certainly a very high-ranking official, if his family could to provide such a rich burial in such a difficult time for Egypt. The most important of the Ouhibra-merineet positions  foreign mercenary commander (these warriors were called helpers in Egyptian tradition). Archaeologists have noticed that the tomb is not finished. Maybe the warlord left. Suddenly, when the cemetery was not yet fully prepared to Take his remains. Commenting on this The find, Secretary General of the Supreme Council for Ancient Affairs of Egypt Dr. Mustafa Waziri noted that This tomb layout has no exact analogues that would be known. The scientists. It is partly reminiscent of the structure of the tomb of the great Ujahorresnet, also found in Abusira, and the tombs. A man named Uhira-em-ahet in Giza (known as the \"Campbell Tombs\"). However, the tomb of the Wahibra-merineate is important. For Egyptologists, it's not just because of its uniqueness. Czech researchers The evidence suggests that, combined with the previously discovered secret, it allows for significant To deepen our understanding of the crisis and turmoil that began in Egypt The era of Persian rule.

    "translated_title": "Novosibirsk archaeologists excavated a pre-Neolithic shrine in Priirtyshye",
    "translated_text": "Novosibirsk archaeologists during their study of the Ust-Tartas-1 settlement of the drum culture discovered and excavated the remains of an ancient shrine where the inhabitants of Priirtyshia were engaged in ritual activities in the VIIVI millennia BC. It is a P-shaped roach surrounded by numerous sacrificial pit. Among the finds are bone and horn items with a moose head and a long bird-shaped cutting tool. Apparently, in the ritual practices of the local inhabitants, a special role was given to the dog, swan, and salmon. This is reported in an article published in the journal Archaeology, Ethnography and Anthropology of Eurasia. Archaeological excavations in recent years have allowed scientists to identify the early Neolithic drum culture in Western Siberia, whose representatives were skilled at making flat-bottomed ceramic vessels. It is known for the Taratas-1, Usty-Tartas-1 and Wengerovo-2 monuments, which are located in the Novosibirsk region. According to the researchers, the drum culture was based on local traditions, which trace their roots back to the Pleistocene era. This is evidenced by the stone industry and the tradition of fish-picking in pits. The Uttar-Tartas-1 monument was discovered by scientists three kilometers from the village of Wengerovo, on the edge of the terrace on the left bank of the Tartas river. It's the remains of an ancient settlement. During his excavations, archaeologists found several deep farm pits inside which were fish bones and scales, animal remains, fragments of ceramics, as well as stone and bone tools (e.g., tools for cleaning fish). The study showed that similar structures were used to harvest and store fish stocks (rarely  meat). According to radio carbon analysis, the settlement existed in the 7th millennium BC. Novosibirsk archaeologists under the leadership of Vyacheslav Molodin of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences have investigated the remains of an ancient shrine discovered in the Wengerovsky district of Novosibirsk region during the study of the Ust-Tartas-1 monument. It is a P-shaped roach enclosing a sacred space of about 320 square meters and numerous pits, including sacrificial ones. In ancient times, it may have also been the site of wooden structures. In the cultural layer of the monument, archaeologists have discovered numerous artifacts, including 68 fragments of ceramics  mostly small fragments of vessel walls. These finds have confirmed that the sanctuary belongs to the early Neolithic drum culture. In addition, 49 stone objects were found, as well as items made of bone and horn, such as a box knife with a horn ornament, as well as a hanging of a moose's cut and a log of a moose's horn. The most valuable find was a 1.5×2,3×0,49 meter pit containing 92 sacred objects. Among them were five scraps, two knife-shaped plates, a polished cloth, 50 fragments of bird bones (possibly a turtle), a fragment of the jaw and bone of a barsock, a swan, and some other animal remains. In addition, the pit contained a horn cone, which may have been part of a ritual mask, as well as a large moose-blade tool, a bone-lifted hammer, and a box knife. Above all these objects was a top made of a moose head with a handle. The scientists noted that the figure is very realistic, for example, with the animal's characteristic curved lip. In addition, the application included a 55-centimeter-long, large-scale moose-shaped tool that was used as a saw or sickle. It was made in the shape of a bird (possibly a swan) with a massive head and neck. For the radiocarbon analysis, scientists selected two bird bones, an animal tooth, and two bone tools. Accelerated mass spectrometry has shown that the sanctuary existed within the range of VIIVI millennia BC. Archaeologists added that the dog played a special role in the ritual practices at the sanctuary. For example, in one of the pits, they found the skull of an old individual with anomalies. They also emphasized the importance of animal teeth as examples. In the performances of the drummen, the swan and the salmon also played an important role. Earlier this year, N+1 was already talking about the studies of the monuments of the drum culture. For example, archaeologists have discovered a cave-reservoir in the Novosibirsk region with a depth of 240 centimeters, which the ancient inhabitants of the Barabin forest used to prepare and crush fish.

It turns out that their joint emergence is best satisfied the conditions of the eruption of the volcano which fed the acidic magma, with following the ash settlement in a lake that existed in the Gale Crater It was 3.7 to 3.0 billion years ago. The study is reported in an article in the journal Earth and Planetary I'm going to science letters. The Martian The crater Gale is notable for having a long history of formation once filled it The deposits are available for The reading in the central heights of the mountain Sharp (Eolida).

Scientists have been able to confirm the previously stated assumption that The crater in the Gesprian period, 3.73.0 billion years ago, represented the It's a water pool. From time to time he dryed up  about this says the findings in the mountain shells of Sharpe The deposition. According to the data, The scientists are gradually refining the stratigraphy of the lower The Sharp Mountains, and determine the mineral and chemical composition of the I'm going to have to go through a lot of layers. The oldest deposits  in the foothills  researchers The group of the Bradbury Formations, which includes the layers of lake argilets, river conglomerates and coastal The sand dunes are of delta origin.

The bottom pack Murray's formation was studied in detail by a Mars rover at the Paramp Hills It's about 25 meters. In the area called Pereval Marayas In 2016, Curiosity discovered the mineral tridymite in a sample of argilite. SiO2 cremation type, which forms at high temperature and low pressure. Subsequent studies have shown that the strength of a layer rich in cremation and including tridimite, reaching a meter, and extending at least It's more than 17 kilometers.

In this case, this mineral was found in the kilns of the Chesapeake impact crater at The coast of the United States. Other locations  are areas of acid volcanism; there The tridimite crystallized from a viscous magma containing many  from 64 to 78 percent of the cremated earth (this type of magma is called a riolite). So the scientists immediately assumed that The formation of tridimite on Mars is probably also related to acid. It's volcanic. The American Researchers led by Valérie Payré of Northern Arizona University tried to determine what was most likely scenario of formation containing tridymite layer in crater I'm not going to tell you. Scientists have used crystallization modeling in the Riolithic Magma, and then we figured out which of the possible ways her products migrated. led to the observed ratio of mineral components in samples from the site The Bakkin.

However, the ash particles still fell into a lake filled with crater. Gale, and the rivers that flowed into it. Water transport of these particles could have contributed to the additional concentration of eruption products in The surrounding layer, so the content of the tridimite in the ash itself was probably Even less than found in the Buckkin's Argyll.

    "translated_title": "A drone with propellers on the propeller turned into a leader",
    "translated_text": "An American engineer designed a drone of unusual design: it has three wings and one propeller on each of them. This allows it to hang on, and fly like an airplane. Since the drone has a laser rangefinder, it acts as a leader when rotated, determining the distance to the surrounding objects. A video describing the project was posted on YouTube. Unmanned aerial vehicles with a multi-copter design are popular because of their simplicity: they only have a few screws and do not need any additional mechanical attachments. They also take off and land vertically, so they're much easier to use on small sites. At the same time, aircraft-type drones are much more efficient than multi-copters because of their lifting force from their wings. There are projects that use both designs. Most often, these are aircraft-type drones with additional screws for vertical takeoff and landing. But there are some instances where screws are attached directly to the wing and the drone is essentially a propeller on a propeller. We've talked about a few similar projects, and all of them have engineers using a pair of wings and screws. One of the problems with this solution is that the drone behaves unstable when flying upwards with the screws, because only two screws are used. The American engineer Nicholas Rehm, who constructs unusual aircraft in his spare time, has created a similar device, but with three wings and screws on them. The center features a control unit, a battery and electric motors that rotate the wings. At the end of each wing is a small screw. The drone can fly in three modes. The first wing is perpendicular to the ground and it flies like a multi-copter using only screws. In the second mode, the wings rotate and the drone starts to rotate in place by means of the screw pull. And in the third mode, it bends and goes into the plane mode with two wings at a small angle to the ground and one perpendicular to the ground. To allow the drone to fly at a single altitude, Rem installed a laser rangefinder in the center. He implemented and demonstrated in practice the control of flight altitude, and also showed that hypothetically the rangefinder can be used for another task. Since the drone has a rotation mode and a rangefinder, it essentially works similar to a two-dimensional leader that sends laser beams in different directions and calculates the distance to objects around it at reflection speed. The problem with the drone is that it doesn't rotate exactly parallel to the ground, but the engineer has shown that even with tilt oscillations, large objects like a fence can be detected. The measurements showed that the drone consumes the least power in a rotation mode instead of an aircraft mode: about 35 watts versus about 70. The engineer suggests that this is due to the wing, which in the plane mode is located above and does not create lifting force. In multi-copter mode, the drone predictably showed the least efficiency of  just over 100 watts. We've also talked about other amateur drones with unusual designs, like a bicopter that looks like a flying stick. Grigory Kopiyev"

    "translated_title": "The oldest sand oasis was discovered in Brazil 's more than 110 million-year-old deposits",
    "translated_text": "Entomologists have described a new species of sand-ocean from Brazil's lowland slopes, aged 121,4113 million years. The insect is called Exallopterus spectabilis. To date, it is the oldest representative of the sand bear. The original version of the article was published in Cretaceous Research. The sandy wasps, or crabronidae, are a large family of conifers, which today includes more than 9,100 species. Some scientists consider the crabronid to be a monophyletic group related to true bees (Apidae), others  paraphyletic, as recent phylogenetic analyses show that bees, as well as the horned wasps (Sphecidae), are located inside the crabronid (1, 2). In both cases, these taxa, along with several other families, belong to the Apoidea group. Crabronids, except for the genus Microstigmus, lead a solitary lifestyle. Adult individuals feed on nectar, while female larvae are fed paralyzed or dead insects. The earliest known members of the group were the crab runes from the Burmese amber, estimated to be about 99 million years old. The more ancient sandy oasis was described by Brazilian entomologists led by Brunno Rosa (Brunno B. Rosa) from the University of São Paulo. The fossil remains of the two individuals have been found in the Brazilian Crato Formation, which is famous for its good preservation of fossils (similar locations are called conservation campstets). The age of deposits of this formation is dated within the aptic jarus of the lower mel (121,4113 million years). The length of one individual was 7.27 millimeters, and the second  8.23 millimeters. Entomologists have classified them as a new genus and species  Exallopterus spectabilis. The genus name translates as \"a completely different wing\", as the new species is very different from other Apoidea from the Cretaceous formation. The name means \"remarkable\" or \"amazing\", since the discovery of a sand owl in the bottom of the mound was unexpected. The scientists have placed E. spectabilis to a separate tribe of Exallopterini. The exact position of this tribe in the family (the authors adhere to the monophyletic crabronid) has not been established. The Paleocentric Formation of the Kratus is reconstructed as a lake with significant seasonal water level fluctuations, which was separated from the dry zone by a belt of gelofites (wet plants) and mesofites (plants adapted to moderate humidity). Rosa and his colleagues believe that E. The spectabilis probably lived in the arid zone, as the flavor of its wings is similar to that of the modern Apoidea from the arid regions. Given that sand axes were found in the Burmese amber, which formed in the humid rainforest, this discovery shows that crab-bones were already in a variety of habitats in the early stages of their evolution. We recently wrote about another find from the Cretaceous Formation: Paleontologists found pine fibers in the Pterosaur tupandactyl, and found that these cover structures were of different colors when they were alive.

    "translated_text": "American researchers have found that strong family ties enable teenagers to be independent, to learn about the world around them, to strive for personal growth, to have a purpose in life, to accept themselves, and to build positive relationships with others. The study, which included data from 3,725 teens from 26 countries, was published in the American Academy of Pediatrics. The environment shapes the development of children. For example, excessive use of gadgets is associated with a decrease in cognitive development, and music is associated with improved memory. The psychological atmosphere in the family is another factor that can both contribute to a child's healthy development and significantly reduce the disclosure of his abilities. Previous studies have shown that even mild corporal punishment may lead to mental and physiological problems in the future, but WHO estimates that about 60 percent of children between the ages of 2 and 14 are still subjected to corporal punishment. The contribution of family well-being and the atmosphere of the home is actively studied for further application of the knowledge gained in psychological practice and social work. Certain family characteristics and closeness can be linked to the disclosure of a child's abilities, so it is important to know exactly how that connection is expressed. Researchers from the United States led by Robert Whitaker of the College of Surgery and General Therapy at Columbia University conducted a study to test whether there was a link between teenagers' relationships with their families and personal development. The authors used the results of a large-scale international survey of children's well-being to analyze the data. The researchers collected data from 11 to 13 year olds from 26 countries, including 37025 teenagers. To collect data, researchers from different countries asked children in schools to take surveys to assess their personal development and family relationships, as well as to answer common questions about family well-being. The success ball was based on six sub-scales: self-acceptance, environmental management (e.g., daily responsibilities), positive relationships with other people, autonomy, personal growth, and purpose in life. The children were asked to rate the statements on a scale from 0 (not entirely agreed) to 10 (completely agreed). The Family Relationship Ball included a score on the following sub-scales: care, support, safety, participation and respect. The teenagers had to indicate their degree of agreement with the claims on a scale from 0 (not entirely agreed) to 4 (completely agreed). For analysis, the authors translated the success scores into a binary scale: teenagers with a score above 8 received the status of successful, and the rest  failed. The researchers found that the most successful adolescents in developing and revealing their personality traits were those who lived with both parents and families who never had financial problems or food shortages. Logistical regression showed that the prevalence of successful adolescent prosperity increased with increased family connectivity, particularly with a communication score of less than 2.5 out of 4 prevalence was 34. She's up to 84.3 percent with a maximum family connection. The authors point out that since in all countries, the subjects were recruited in schools, this approach excluded from the sample of adolescents who did not attend classical educational institutions. Early development is important in human life, so many studies are aimed at children from infancy. In previous papers, we've talked about how early education in poor families affects brain development, and how developing videos have proven to be ineffective for children under the age of two, unlike sleep, which helps children replenish their vocabulary.

The live broadcast from the mission control center was on Youtube. The DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) task is to tarnish the 160-meter-long asteroid Dimorph, which is part of the near-Earth double-body asteroid system (65803) Dimorph, which is not a threat to Earth. The probe is equipped with the only scientific instrument  DRACO camera, which continuously takes images of the Dimorph and transmits them to the autonomous navigation system SMART Nav, which in turn corrects the flight path by pointing the probe at the asteroid. These images are transmitted to Earth in a compact format (512 x 512 pixels), at a rate of about one frame per second. Two hours before the bargain, scheduled for the night of September 27, 2022, DART went into fully autonomous mode, and less than an hour before the DRACO bargain, Dimmorf himself first considered it, which is only 1.2 kilometres from the 780-meter-long Didi. In the photo, Didim looks like a bright spot, above and to the right of which you can see a more dimmer Dimorph. The taran itself is expected to occur at 2:14 Moscow time, changing the period of DiMorph's rotation around Dimim by 4-7 minutes, and in the last minutes of its existence the probe will receive the most accurate images of Dimorph. The success of the project will be discussed when the observations from the ground and space telescopes behind the Didium are analyzed, and the impact crater will be photographed in the coming days by the Italian cubsat LICIACube, which was launched into space with DART and separated from it a few days before tarn.

    "translated_title": "A hydrogel robot was taught to crawl like a rainworm",
    "translated_text": "American researchers have created a crawling robot based on a hydrogel capable of directed controlled movement. It moves by contact forces, similar to how rainworms crawl. Scientists were able to change the direction and speed of its motion by manipulating the components of the structure, thanks to the properties of the hydrogel to respond to thermal impact. The robot is made of two-layer polymers connected by a linker, requires no wiring, electricity or power, and can be useful in biomedical and microfluidic applications. The article was published in Science Robotics. Pneumatic, hydraulic and electric drives have long been used in soft robotics to move mechanisms. For example, scientists equipped the robot arm with pneumatic membrane actuators and used a hydraulic drive to create a mobile transparent robot, and Korean engineers made a soft actuator that was based on an electric osmosis. At the same time, soft robots have taken their place in biomedical science. For example, in surgery and endoscopy, they can operate inside the human body, delivering medicines to the target, and in the field of wound healing, they can not only come into direct contact with living tissue, but also replace organs and muscles. However, for applications in areas so closely connected to humans or where space for their activities is very limited, robots that require no wires, electricity, or power are needed. The most complex aspect is the mode of actuation, the method by which the robot or parts of it are moved. Soft robot developers often use hydrogels  flexible polymer materials that absorb water. They can respond to environmental stimuli, are bio-compatible and can adapt to complex and dynamic environments, making them suitable for physical interaction with fragile objects or living organisms. To create such technologies, researchers are inspired by biological systems, mimicking their motor systems. They made robots crawl in response to light stimulation and developed hydrogel caterpillars that responded to changes in the magnetic field. However, for their movement, a substrate was required, in the first case  of polyvinyl chloride, in the second  of patterned glass. This condition greatly limits their applicability, for example, in human-robot interaction. A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University led by Aishwarya Pantula proposed that the robot itself be designed to solve this problem. They were inspired by the movement of the rainworm and came up with a system of two biscuits of different lengths and a liner-layer between them. Each robot element is made of a hydrogel and can swell and contract under the influence of external factors. This design allowed it to be systematically and asynchronously modified to disrupt the symmetry of the contact forces and thus make it move along a flat substrate without any pattern. For bislows and links, scientists selected two hydrogels with different properties: a temperature-reactive active poly ((N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) and a passive polyacrylamide (pAAM). They are phased in at low critical temperatures, close to human physiological conditions, and swell and contract in the temperature range of 30 to 60 degrees. They created two bicycles with the greatest difference in curvature at deformation  so that the motion was more noticeable. The components were printed on a 3D printer. The robot was placed on a silicone substrate, placed in water, and subjected to a cooling-heating cycle. During the half-cycle of cooling, scientists observed both segments bending due to the swelling of the hydrogel. At the same time, the linker, under the influence of the temperature, hung and touched the surface as if becoming an anchor, and attracted the segments to itself. The outer ends of the beads also touched the surface, so the robot bent. When the cooling was replaced by heating, the robot segments became flat, then curved, the linker straightened and returned to its original state, and the two blades became curved. Because of the difference in size and curvature, the anchor became a larger bishop, and the smaller bishop and linker were drawn to it. The result was a robot moving along the surface. The researchers conducted five such thermal cycles and noticed that it slid consistently in the direction of a larger bishop, moving about 4.4 percent of its length in one cycle. It's moved a total of 12 millimeters. The scientists then suggested that the rigidity of the liner would affect the robot's \"walk\". They printed the same two-segment robot with the same size, but replaced the flexible pNIPAM linker with a harder pAAM linker. During the half-cycle of cooling, the rigid linker retained a flat shape, remained suspended between the blades and ceased to serve as an anchor. As a result, the asymmetry of the pure contact force between the large and small biscuits increased, and the one-way shift increased from 4.4 to 5.6% of the body length per cycle. Then the researchers made the linker look like an accordion, alternating the pNIPAM and pAAM stripes, and increased the number of biscuits to four. During the half-cycle of cooling, the linker was lengthened and barely touched the surface. Because the contact area was larger on the side of two large biscuits, the robot moved constantly in their direction, shifting 12.2% of its body length per cycle. The experiment confirmed that changing the robot's morphology could affect the direction and speed of its motion. However, the pace of movement remained very slow  one cycle lasted 6 hours. According to the researchers, if needed, these helium robots can also be accelerated by changing the diffusion length of the bicycle or by incorporating nonlinear chemical or mechanical processes into the development. They also note that robots can operate autonomously even when temperature fluctuates. In the future,  heating or cooling systems can be integrated into the robot's body to facilitate programmed or autonomous work in small water spaces regardless of ambient temperature. With the help of hydrogels, scientists imitate not only the mechanical but also the biological processes of living organisms. For example, Finnish researchers have developed a system of two adjacent hydrogels that can regulate itself and maintain its temperature within a narrow range despite changing external conditions."

They are characterized by a large wavelength and have been observed in the ultraviolet wavelength range, the mission tweeted. Unlike Earth, Mars has no global magnetic field, but it does have local fields due to the residual magnetism of the planet's surface. Because of this, the brightness on Mars can be seen in the equatorial regions. Scientists have identified three types of Martian rays caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the planet's magnetic field: proton, diffuse, and discrete. Until recently, scientists had only observed proton beams, and other types of beams could not be studied in detail. The images of the rays were taken by EMUS (Emirates Mars Ultraviolet Spectrometer) at a wavelength of 130.4 nanometers. They extend for several thousand kilometers, from the day to the night side of Mars, and they originate in the upper atmosphere and look like long, wormlike structures. They are radiated by excited atmospheric atoms, such as oxygen. These glowing rays were observed when solar plasma flows came to Mars, causing the atmosphere to be affected by faster and more turbulent solar wind electron flows.

    "translated_title": "Physicists have experimentally confirmed quantum pseudo-telepathia .",
    "translated_text": "Chinese physicists experimented with the quantum game of Mermin  Peres using hyperconfused photons. This game is an example of quantum pseudo-telepathy, a game in which quantum solutions give a 100% guarantee of success. In practice, scientists have won 94 out of 100 cases because of noise and optical circuitry, but this is much higher than the classical success rate of 89 percent. The study was published in Physical Review Letters. Quantum mechanics has expanded many scientific disciplines, introducing concepts such as coherence, quantum superposition, and quantum entanglement. This includes game theory, which has been quantumly expanded to explore many new strategies that have an advantage over classical solutions. So a quantum computer can beat the classic in Magic Square and find a quantum variant of the sixth order Euler's square that doesn't have a classic analog. Historically, quantum games have been used to conceptually test quantum nonlocality. If these correlations are an objective phenomenon, not our lack of knowledge of the system, then the chances of winning a game with one or more players should be different than in the classic case. The simplest quantum game is Bell's inequality test, which first experimentally tested the theory of hidden parameters. Since then, physics and mathematics have offered games where this difference is most noticeable. The culmination of this search was the game, where the odds of success were 100 percent thanks to quantum strategies. In the context of games, communication between players is forbidden, so from a classical perspective, absolute victory looks like the participants are communicating information to each other in some paranormal way. That's why these games have been called quantum pseudo-telepathy. The simplest example of quantum pseudo-telepathy is a game independently proposed by Mermin and Perez, in which participants must fill a magic square 3×3. The experimental implementation of the Mermin  Perez game, however, is complicated by the fact that it requires the distribution of two entangled states of two cubits and the localization of local measurements in different entangled pairs. The first to overcome these challenges was Jia-Min Xu of the Chinese University of Science and Technology and her colleagues. They were helped by the generation of hypercontaining photon pairs in which correlation arises not only between traditional polarisation degrees of freedom but also between states with different orbital angular moments. Using a quantum random number generator to survey Alice and Bob, the scientists were able to win the game 94 percent of the time, which is significantly higher than the classical limit. In the Mermina  Peres game, participants (Alice and Bob) must fill the square with 3×3 bits that can take the values +1 and 1. The referee asks for a random line from Alice and a random column from Bob at the same time. Alice's answer should contain a fixed number of negative units (i.e. the product of all three numbers in a row should be equal to +1), and Bob's  is uncountable (the product should be equal to 1). The line and the column intersect in one square cell, and if the values of Alice and Bob match in it, the players are awarded a win. The important thing is that it's impossible to make a classic 3×3 square that would satisfy the requirements of Alice and Bob (i.e., lines and columns). When it is filled in, players will have at least one value (all nine scenarios). That means the classic game has a winning margin of 8/9. In the quantum version of the game, however, it is possible to achieve a hundred percent victory. For this, the referee must send requests to the players in the form of the most hyperconfused state, that is, one that is the most confused by two different independent variables encoding rows and columns. It turns out that you can pick three measurement bases for each participant so that the output of three respective projection operators will give a single for Alice and a negative one for Bob, but the measurement result of the overall cell will always be the same. To test the theory, physicists used two 0.6 millimetre-thick baryl borate beta crystals glued together so that their optical axes were perpendicular. When the resulting structure is pumped with laser light pulses at a wavelength of 390 nanometers, the hyper-contact photons are born in a spontaneous parametric dispersion process with a decrease in frequency and are directed to the players. The quantum random number generator generated a base number for Alice and Bob to measure photons. The signal was transmitted to the players' measurement circuits and controlled the orientation of the half-wave plates that were part of their composition. Physicists conducted 1,075 930 rounds of the game, during which matches occurred in 1,009,610 cases, which corresponds to 93.84 ± 0.02 percent of success. This is significantly higher than the classical limit of 88.89 percent. Because of the noise that occurs in the process of spontaneous parametric dispersion, as well as the imperfections of optical interferometers, a hundred percent victory cannot be achieved in real experience. Nevertheless, the results of the physicists clearly prove the superiority of quantum strategy in the Mermin  Perez game, thus becoming an experimental demonstration of quantum pseudo-telepathy. The result was a result of the experimenters' extensive work to confuse the various degrees of freedom of photons. Not long ago, we were telling you how physicists confused their polarization and spatial distribution. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "Cholesterol metabolism of the female octopuses to self-destruct after mating",
    "translated_text": "The female octopuses selflessly care for their eggs, then die of starvation and rapid aging. Biologists have found that the self-destruct of these head-footed molluscs after mating is associated with changes in cholesterol metabolism in the visual glands. It forms more 7-dehydrocholesterol, as well as some steroid hormones and bile acids. They increase maternal care and at the same time push the octopus to death. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal Current Biology. Octopuses are short-lived. The males of these head-footed mollusks usually die shortly after mating, and the females for several months (or, in some cases, years) protect and ventilate the egg layers. All this time, they don't eat, they get old quickly, they self-harm, and eventually they die. Scientists know that the reproduction and life span of octopuses are regulated by the visual glands  analogues of the pituitary gland (if removed, the female will drop the litter, start feeding again and live several months longer than usual). However, the exact chemical compounds that trigger rapid aging remain unknown. A team of biologists led by Yang Wang (Z. Yan Wang, from the University of Chicago. To do this, researchers caught several California double-headed octopuses (Octopus bimaculoides) in the wild, including females that guard the treasure. Then the molluscs were killed, their visual glands removed, and their tissue transcribed. Wang and her colleagues found that the visual glands of adult octopus females produce signaling molecules of two main types: neuropeptides and steroid hormones. However, after mating, the activity of the genes that encode the neuropeptides decreases. On the contrary, the genes that encode the enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones begin to express themselves more strongly. These enzymes include cholesterol-7-desaturase. It converts cholesterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol, which controls the maturation and longevity of many invertebrates. Interestingly, in humans, a mutation that causes elevated levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol leads to severe developmental and behavioral disorders (called Smith's  Lemley's  Opitz's syndrome). For example, people with this mutation often cause self-harm, which is similar to the behavior of the female octopus at the end of life. Additional experiments confirmed that cholesterol-7-desaturase is expressed in the visual glands of octopuses, but not in the brain's neighboring tissues, and that synthesis of this enzyme is enhanced in mated females. Using fluid chromatomasse spectrometry, Wang and her co-authors found that the cholesterol levels in the female's visual glands did not change after mating, but the concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol increased. Gas chromatomasse spectrometry has detected a diverse set of other sterins in the octopus glands, including lanosterol, digidrolanosterol, desmosterol, and cholestanol. Their presence indicates that the metabolism of cholesterol in the visual glands goes two ways: the Bloh pathway (cholesterol synthesis from desmosterol) and the Kandutch-Rassel pathway (cholesterol synthesis from 7-dehydrocholesterol with the help of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase). Because cholesterol levels remain the same after mating and decomposing levels, the authors believe that the activity of the Canduch-Russell pathway in fertilized female octopuses remains the same, and that the Bloh pathway is intensified to produce more 7-dehydrocholesterol and its metabolites. Using fluid chromatomasse spectrometry, Wang and his co-authors also found elevated progesterone levels in the eyes of mated females. In mammals, this compound plays an important role in regulating menstrual cycle and pregnancy. In addition, researchers have found about 3,200 compounds in the female's visual glands that have changed in concentration after mating. Most of these are linked to the metabolism of sterins and bile acids. The authors focused on two substances whose concentration in the visual glands increased after mating. The first one is a prisoner of war. In mammals, this compound is formed from cholesterol with 20,22-desmolaze and serves as a basis for synthesis of all steroid hormones (steroidogenesis). For example, the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxysteuroid dehydrogenase converts pregnenolone into progesterone. Since the progesterone concentration is elevated in the visual glands of fertilized octopus females and there are no other progenolone derivatives, it can be assumed that progenolone is used in them mainly for progesterone synthesis. The second substance Wang and her co-authors have been looking at is 7α-hydroxycholestone. This is the starting point for bile acid synthesis. For example, a human can produce henoxyacolic acid. The eyes of octopuses have a precursor to this acid, but not the same (the iron acids of mammals are not produced in vertebrates at all). Thus, after mating in the visual glands of the female octopus, the cholesterol metabolism changes dramatically. The synthesis of three important derivatives of this compound is increased: 7-dehydrocholesterine; steroid hormones derived from pregnenolone; and 7α-hydroxycholestenone, a precursor of bile acids. Scientists have long known that progesterone and other prognenolone derivatives regulate reproductive processes, but this function is first described for 7-dehydrocholesterol and bile acids. High levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol are likely to be toxic to octopuses (as well as humans) or lead to the production of signaling factors that kill these molluscs. Certain bile acids may play a similar role. This is evidenced by the fact that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the dapharonic acids, the bile derivatives, regulate life expectancy. The authors suggest that various chemical compounds that are actively produced in the visual glands of female octopuses after mating and are involved in self-destruction of these molluscs, affect different types of tissue  or work synergistically, simultaneously enhancing maternal care and provoking rapid aging. Octopuses and other head-footed mollusks are removed from objects that pose a physical threat to them. For a long time, however, biologists could not confirm that these creatures experienced pain.

    "translated_title": "Because of warming oceans , the North Atlantic hurricane season started earlier .",
    "translated_text": "American climatologists have recorded a gradual shift in the start of the hurricane season in the North Atlantic. Since 1900, the average hurricane season starts five days earlier every ten years, and the coast hurricanes reach two days earlier. Researchers believe this is due to warming of the ocean's surface. The article was published in Nature Communication. Hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones that form in seven basins. They're seen there every month, but the big ones are more common in the summer. They originate on both sides of the equator in the intratropical convergence zone. Within this low-pressure zone, the air is heated above the warm tropical ocean and rises, causing thunderstorms to form. Rainfall can form a cluster of thunderstorms  this creates a flow of warm, humid air that quickly rushes upwards, and the Earth's rotation causes cyclonic circulation. Since 1965, the Atlantic hurricane season has been considered the period from June to November. The Atlantic coast of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and Bermuda islands are particularly affected by hurricanes. But hurricane season  are not strictly fixed dates and meteorologists have already noticed that they sometimes go beyond the generally accepted time frame: in 20122020, for example, seven tropical cyclones developed before June 1. A group of U.S. climate scientists led by Ryan Truchelut of the University of Colorado analyzed data on Atlantic cyclones from 1900 to 2020. Scientists used historical data, reports from the National Hurricane Center, satellite observations, and modern climate data sets (e.g., ERA5). The analysis revealed a trend toward the early onset of hurricane formation in the North Atlantic basin. On average, the hurricane season started five days earlier every ten years. And the powerful hurricanes that hit the coast and hit land started two days earlier every ten years. In the period from April to May, the hurricane generation potential index is growing steadily. This trend is likely due to the fact that spring is becoming a more favorable time of year for tropical cyclones to form earlier. This is directly related to the rising ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic. The results of the study indicate that part of May should also be included in the hurricane season. This is particularly important for improving hurricane warning and detection systems. We've written before that global annual average temperature increases are slowing tropical cyclones. In some regions, their speed has decreased by 30 percent. Alexander Marfin is the"

    "translated_title": "Mother line inheritance helped the weavers to produce eggs of different colors",
    "translated_text": "Among the cockroaches, the nesting parasites native to Africa, there are several ecological breeds that lay eggs of different colors depending on the species of bird they specialize in. Ornithologists have found that the genes responsible for egg blossoming are found in the tissues on the female sex chromosome, and each of the ecological races is an evolutionary branch in which inheritance goes down the maternal line. This feature allows for the phenotypic diversity within a species to be maintained and adapted to different hosts. However, it prevents the combination of different traits in the genome of an individual. In the long run, some ecological cockroach breeds may lose the arms race with their victims. The results of the study were published in an article for the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Ornithologists have long noted that among the common cockroaches (Cuculus canorus) there are several ecological breeds that parasitise on different species of birds. The females of each of these breeds lay eggs of a certain color that matches the color of their owners' eggs. For example, chickens laying blue eggs are usually victims of burning cows. Similar ecological breeds have been found in some other winged nesting parasites that exploit several host species. It is still unknown how such phenotypic diversity arises and is maintained within a single species. According to the most popular hypothesis, the genes responsible for egg blossoming are on the female W-chromosome and are inherited through the maternal line (unlike humans, birds have a heterogametic sex  female). In the first few months of life, the young female remembers her adoptive parents and in the future lays eggs for the same species. In this way, males mate with females regardless of their ecological race. Attempts to test this idea have so far yielded mixed results. For example, researchers have found that the common chicks that lay blue eggs belong to one evolutionary branch with a maternal lineage. However, another maternal lineage of chickens includes individuals that lay eggs of varying colors and parasitize on different species of birds. And the big indicators have two ancient mother lines. The representatives of the first choose as adoptive parents for their cubs birds nesting in nests, and the representatives of the second  those nesting on trees. Each of these lines is divided into smaller ecological races parasitic on specific species of birds, but these races no longer correspond to secondary maternal lines. The team of ornithologists led by Claire Spottiswood (Claire N. Spottiswoode) from Cambridge University decided to find out how the ancestry of a particular ecological breed is inherited from the chicken weavers (Anomalospiza imberbis). These members of the widow family (Viduidae) live in sub-Saharan Africa and parasitise on small singing birds  cisticola (Cisticola) and prania (Prinia). The female weavers throw away their own eggs and replace them with their own, and the young nesting parasites compete so actively with their half-brothers and sisters for food that they starve to death. In one nest, several weavers may develop at once. However, it is not easy to deceive the cyst and the prynium. They regularly check the hatches and lay eggs that differ in color and size from their own. Moreover, each individual lays eggs that differ slightly in color. For example, eggs of the ostrich-sided prania (Prinia subflava) may have a blue, white, red or olive background with an individual red pattern on top. That's how the bird knows all the eggs in its nest. To parasitize on cyst and pronia, the chicken tissue must adapt to the interspecies as well as the intra-species differences in the color of their eggs. Spottiswood and her co-authors traveled to Southern Zambia, where the chicken weaves parasitize on three species of cyst and one species of prine. In 2007-2009 and 2012-2014, researchers collected genetic samples from 196 weavers from 141 nests of cyst and prine. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA and W-chromosome showed that all the pollen tissue in the sites studied belonged to two mother lines that separated about 2.3 million years ago. The representatives of one specialize in the prania and lay blue, red and white eggs with a red pattern, while the representatives of the second prefer the cyst. Within each of the lines, the authors found traces of further diversification. The \"line of cystics\" is divided into three secondary branches corresponding to three local types of cystics: redhead (C. The most commonly used type of erythrops is the erythropus (C. The first is the natalensis and the venous-tailed (C. The juncidis . Females from the first branch lay greenish-blue spotted eggs, from the second branch - light eggs with almost no pests, and from the third branch - light eggs with a large amount of pests. The color of the eggs of each branch of the tissue matches the color of the eggs of the species of cyst on which they parasitize. Moreover, the secondary \"line of red-faced cysts\" has recently split into two other branches. Females of both lay greenish-blue spotted eggs, but birds of the first branch are bright, and birds of the second branch are pale. The two color variants correspond to the two egg phenotypes that are typical of red-faced cysts. It should be noted that feathered and tail-like cysticoles also lay eggs of different colors, and among the chicken weaves there are individuals specialized in parasiting on different phenotypic variants of these species. However, only tissue was found in the sample, parasitic on brightly-colored cystics with light eggs almost without a piston and on brightly-colored cistics with a large number of piston-coated tails. In turn, the \"line of prions\", which specializes in octopus prions, is divided into two branches. The first representative lays eggs with a background from blue to white and a redish-blue spot pattern, and the second representative lays eggs with a background from red to white and a redish-blue pattern. They parasitize on egg-laying fins of the corresponding phenotypes. Some octopus-sided primates lay olive-backed eggs, but their \"line of primates\" weaves have not learned to reproduce them. In the next stage, Spottiswood and his co-authors analyzed genetic differences between four of the six ecological breeds of chicken tissue and concluded that they were concentrated on the female W-chromosome (since the mitochondrial genome consists of a relatively small number of vital genes, egg coloring genes cannot be located here). They were able to identify deep differences between individuals parasitic on pronia and their relatives who prefer cystics. In addition, five genetic variants on the W chromosome distinguish the \"prine line\" weavers with blue and red eggs respectively. Four other variants on the female sex chromosome differ between two breeds that have adapted to laying eggs on two different types of cysts. The researchers assumed that different ecological breeds of chicken tissue had split into different species  or were doing so in front of us. However, an analysis of 6184 autosomal genetic locuses, based on material from 38 unrelated individuals, showed that there is no reproductive isolation between tissues from different maternal lines  that is, they form a single population. When choosing a mate, males and females of this species do not take into account who their adoptive parents were. Spottiswood and her colleagues also studied the genome of one of the victims of the chicken weaves, the chrysolid primate. After analyzing the mitochondrial DNA of 121 females of this species, the researchers found no evidence that different phenotypes of egg coloration in this species correspond to different maternal lines. Thus, in the prinium, unlike the tissues responsible for egg coloring, the genes are not on the W chromosome, but on the autosomes. The results of the study confirm that nest parasites can maintain significant phenotypic diversity by inheriting the genes responsible for egg coloring along the maternal line. Further diversification of these lines allows them to run a successful arms race with owners who try to avoid parasitism, increasing the variety of egg color. According to Spottiswood and her co-authors, if a nesting parasite develops a mutation on one of the autos that changes the color of the eggs, it will most likely be transferred to the W-chromosome: it will not give the females an evolutionary advantage over males. However, in the long run, such a strategy can be risky. The fact is that the W chromosome, except for a small fragment, does not recombine with other chromosomes and is inherited as a whole unit. As a result, nesting parasites miss the opportunity to combine the traits of different ecological races into one. For example, female coconut-weaving \"priny line\" lay blue or reddish eggs, which are colored by biliverdin or protoporphyrins. However, they cannot use both of these pigments to stain the shell at the same time, meaning they cannot lay olive-colored eggs. At the same time, their victims have horny-sided prinias, genes associated with egg coloring, located on the autosomes. This allows some phenotypes to lay olive eggs that the weavers cannot forge (besides, it helps the prinia and cystics lay eggs with individual patterns that are easily distinguished from the ones dropped). Since this feature effectively protects the larvae from nesting parasites, natural selection should support it. It is easy to imagine that in the future the tendency to postpone olive eggs will be widespread among the population of ostrich cysts. Since the ecological breeds of weavers specialized in the heritage of the herd will not be able to start laying olive eggs, they risk losing the evolutionary arms race and disappearing. These findings are consistent with the Black Queen hypothesis that a species needs constant change and adaptation to survive in a world that is constantly evolving with it. Nest parasites must take into account not only the color but also the shape of the eggs. For example, deaf coconuts (C. The species is known as the \"Optatus\" and is a parasite of the fox. It lays eggs that are as broad as possible as the female's eggs. Sergei Kelenov"

    "translated_title": "Waymo's unmanned trucks will start to ship Uber Freight orders",
    "translated_text": "Waymo has announced a partnership with Uber Freight. First, the service orders will start to transport trucks from its own fleet, and then third-party machines using the Waymo software-hardware platform will join them. Waymo initially designed only lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles for passenger transport, but since 2018 has also been testing cargo unmanned aerial vehicles: trailers and minivans. Gradually, the company expanded the testing area, and then began partnering with logistics companies to test the unmanned trucks for real-world tasks. She started transporting cargo for UPS, and earlier this year, she signed a partnership with J. B. Hunt and C. H. I'm not going to be here. Now Waymo has announced that its cars will be carrying orders placed on Uber Freight  a freight service running on a model similar to a regular Uber. In the first phase, Waymo will add its own unmanned trucks to the service. Uber Freight customers can order their freight on them as they would on a regular car. In the second phase, third-party trucks with Waymo's autonomous driving system will also be available. Earlier, the company said it plans to act as a technology provider rather than own a fleet of unmanned vehicles or create its own transportation service. In particular, Waymo has already agreed with Daimler that it will produce trucks that will use the Waymo software-hardware platform. Waymo and Uber have been involved in a three-year lawsuit involving unmanned trucks. In 2017, Waymo accused Uber of its unmanned aerial vehicle manager Anthony Lewandowski stealing the company's intellectual property, including leadership technology. Lewandowski co-founded the Google drone project, which later became a separate company, Waymo. In 2016, he quit Waymo and founded his own company Otto, which developed unmanned trucks, and six months later Uber bought it. As a result, Uber made a deal with Waymo to give it 0.34 percent of the company, and Lewandowski was sentenced to a year and a half in prison and owed Google up to $30 million. Other companies are also successfully using unmanned vehicles. For example, TuSimple announced earlier this year that it was starting to drive commercial cargoes in cars with no people in the cabin. Aurora and Embark have also made notable progress in unmanned trucks."

    "translated_title": "Flaksonic qubits have saved quantum valves from error",
    "translated_text": "Russian physicists have assembled a two-cubit quantum processor from the flaksonums of superconducting qubits. They can be controlled by magnetic flux, which allows the authors to implement high-precision one- and two-cubic valves. The work was published in the journal npj Quantum Information. The basis of any superconducting cube is the Josephson transition. In the simplest and historically first version, the qubit's state depends on the position of the electron pair (the Cooper's), such qubits are called charged. They are two superconductors separated by a thin layer of dielectric. By changing the voltage applied to the superconductors, the copper pair can be transferred from one superconductor to another via a dielectric barrier. Because of the high noise and sensitivity to external fields, processors on charging qubits cannot boast of high accuracy of operations and long life. To combat noise, the Josephson transition circuit is most often shunted by a condenser. Although the transmitter has a longer one-time operation than the charging cube, its lifetime allows more operations to be performed in one cycle. The complexity of a single operation over a qubit depends on how the energy levels of the Josephson transition are located. The transition itself has more than two levels, and for the qubit you need to choose two  to assign a value of 0, to another 1. If the distances between all levels are the same, then this is more difficult than in the case of an unharmonic transition  when the distance between levels is different and you can choose two nearby levels that have neighboring levels that are far away. It turns out that replacing the capacitor with an inductance coil in the transformer preserves both the transition's disharmony and the life of the cube. Such qubits are called flaksonic because they can be controlled by magnetic flux. That's why the Flaksonums are more sensitive to external magnetic currents, which can affect their coherence time. Yet, this defect can be overcome. A group of Russian scientists from NITU MISIS, the Russian Quantum Center, the MFI under the leadership of Ilya Besedin has experimentally shown how to do this. Physicists have developed a two-cube chip and have performed one- and two-cube operations on it with 99.5 and 99.2 percent accuracy, respectively. In addition to the two working qubits, physicists added a third qubit to the scheme, which allowed them to get rid of unnecessary interactions between qubits when performing one-qubit operations and to implement two-qubit operations. The authors were able to improve the accuracy of the operations by having different control signal frequencies for two-cubic and one-cubic operations, and by controlling the qubits separately, they could adjust the frequencies of each. To control the cube-link operation and understand how to control it, scientists calibrated the cube-linking pattern and measured the cube-linking force as the energy changes when it moves from state 10 to state 01 depending on the displacement of the flow in the connection element and the duration of the pulses. They approximated the state fluctuations of 01 with harmonic oscillations for each cube-link shift and used these dependencies to control. Topologically, the processor is three circuits with Josephson transitions, shunted by inductivity coils. The entire circuit has eight contact paths: three of them are needed to control each of the qubits, three more to displace the qubits, one to control the external magnetic flow, and the last  output of the circuit. If the reciprocal inductivity of the cube and its control line is small, then it has to pass high-amplitude currents. In the opposite situation, with a high reciprocal inductivity, the cube's control line becomes a source of loss for it, adding errors to the calculations. The authors tried to use small amplitudes of currents, but to transfer a qubit from its original state requires high currents, which lead to phase errors. There are two ways to combat them: adding an additional signal in the orthogonal direction and using virtual Z-ventiles. The first author used  for the accuracy of the calculations, and the second  for all other measurements. The accuracy of operations is characterized by the degree of coincidence of the one-cubic operations in an experiment with predicting the theoretical model. In physics, they forced a two-cube processor to perform long sequences of random one- and two-cube benchmarking and compared the probabilities of output states with the theory. In addition to determining the degree of coincidence, this method allowed to determine the parameters of the valves used and to set up the scheme even more accurately. Any quantum algorithm should include \"confusing\" valves, so as a demonstration of a two-cubic gate, physicists chose the controlled-Z gate. For this they needed five single-cubic and two-cubic fSim valves (it was convenient to sell on superconducting qubits). Applying a different number of consecutive CZ operations to the input state allowed us to assess how quiet a single valve turns out to be. The CZ matching rate in the experiment and the theory was 99.23 percent  which is a very good result. Flaksonic qubits can be a viable alternative to transmissions, including by using sub-hyper-gertz electronics to control qubits. It should make the existing systems much simpler. However, for experiments with superconducting processors, the most common uses are transmissions. For example, another Russian research group assembled and tested a four-cubit computer on a broadcast, and IBM employees were able to fit 433 cubic bits into one integrated chip."

    "translated_text": "The new vaccine against coronavirus from Russia, \"Konvasel\", based on N-protein, has entered civilian circulation. The Federal Medical and Biological Agency (FMBA) suggests that it will be effective against new strains, including \"Cerber\", reports TASS, citing the head of the FMBA. It is the fourth vaccine developed in Russia and available for mass use. Previous domestic vaccines were based on inactivated virus (\"CoviVak\"), peptide antigens (\"EpiVakKorona\") and human adenoviruses (\"Sputnik V\"). The tests revealed the ineffectiveness of the EpiVacCorona vaccine from the Vector Center. And this is Sputnik V, according to the latest research from the Space Shuttle Center. Gamalei showed an efficacy of 87.6-97 percent during the omechron wave for those people who received two to three doses of the vaccine (effectiveness was higher in more serious cases than in the mild course of the disease). The new two-factor vaccine \"Konvasel\", developed at the St. Petersburg Research Institute of Vaccines and Serum FMBA, is based on the recombinant N-protein of SARS-Cov-2. N-protein, one of four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, is capable of stimulating immune system cells and is often used to make vaccines. This method allows the immune system to learn to recognize the virus and react quickly to its onset. The FMBA believes it may be effective against various strains, including the Cerberus. This is possible because the N-protein SARS-CoV-2 has not changed in any known variant of the virus. In addition, the vaccine's creators claim that it does not cause allergies. So far, we've been testing on people between the ages of 18 and 60. Whether it is as effective and safe for people over 60 will be known soon. We've talked about other developments in the fight against coronavirus. For example, the FMBA Institute of Immunology has developed an inhaled drug for the treatment of COVID, and the Center for Immunology has developed an inhaled drug. Gamalaie published the results of the \"Sputnik\" nasal test. For more information on the effectiveness of vaccines, see our article \"We Moved Here\"."

It is expected that in the future, white dwarfs will form in the system, which will result in an explosion if they merge. The article was published in the journal Nature Astronomy. Type Ia supernovae occur when the mass of a white dwarf accretionary substance in a double system exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, causing a thermonuclear explosion or when two white dwarfs merge. For astronomers, such flashes are important in determining the distance to the galaxies in which they are located. However, the explosion mechanisms are still poorly studied and scientists are looking for future supernovae, which may include not only double, but also triple or four star systems. A team of astronomers led by Thibault Merle of the Free University of Brussels has announced that they have identified a new future progenitor of the supernova type Ia, which is the fourth star system, HD 74438. It was discovered in 2017 as part of the Gaia-ESO Survey. Subsequent observations of the system using ground-based telescopes allowed us to determine its properties. HD 74438 is part of one of the youngest (about 43 million years) scattered clusters of the Sun, IC 2391, located in the constellation Parus. It consists of two short-period pairs of stars, one of which orbits the other with an orbital period of 5.7 years. Spectral class of the system was rated A5. Scientists have concluded that the orbital interaction of stars with each other and their evolution will lead to the formation of white dwarfs in the system. Their merger, which will take place over the next few billion years, will lead to the explosion of a supernova subchandra secura. We've been talking about how a drop star has pointed to the future progenitor of a type Ia supernova. Alexander Voytyk"

The results will allow planetary scientists to track the evolution of the comet's core as it approaches the Sun, ESA reports. Rosetta has explored the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov  Gerasimenko from its orbit between 2014 and 2016. During this time, the comet has successfully passed another perigee of its orbit and has begun to move away from the Sun, which has led to changes in both the lighting conditions of the comet and its activity level. The device received a huge number of images of the surface of the core, which showed signs of falling rock, rock shifting and falling boulders. Tracking these processes is important for planetary scientists who are building a picture of the evolution of cometary nuclei. On May 5, 2022, the European Space Agency announced that it had launched the Rosetta Zoo project based on the civil science portal Zooniverse. Its mission is to help astronomers working with the OSIRIS camera's image archive analyze images of the comet's surface to find any changes from large-scale dust transfer to rock destruction and rock displacement. Anyone can participate in the project, but only a computer and internet access are required. You don't have to register for the project. Volunteers should examine two images of the same region on the comet taken at different times and note the differences found between them. You can also increase, decrease, and rotate the images. Based on the project, maps of the surface evolution of the comet's nucleus will be created, and scientists will use them to establish a link between the nucleus' activity and the change in its surface morphology. During two years of work near the comet Rosetta, it found xenon, anias, precursors of sugars, high molecular organic matter, unusual rocks, saw the change in the color of the nucleus and the glow in the comet, and also landed the Phylos probe on the comet for the first time in history.

    "translated_title": "Scientists have described possible mechanisms of LSD's impact on memory and learning",
    "translated_text": "Researchers from Brazil, the UK, and Spain described the properties of LSD associated with increased brain plasticity and showed a link to improved memory and learning. The results of the experiments on mice and humans have been published in Experimental Neurology. In recent decades, researchers have been actively studying the therapeutic properties of psychoactive substances, including diethylamide d-lysergic acid (LSD)  a semi-synthetic substance based on lysergic acid derived from sporin. A small dose of LSD, a serotonin receptor agonist, can relieve pain without causing a strong psychedelic effect, as well as reduce fear levels. Recent studies suggest that the therapeutic effect of LSD may be linked to improved neurogenesis, as well as neuroplasticity  the ability of the nervous system to respond to internal or external stimuli by altering its structure, function, and communication. However, experiments in mice and humans have shown conflicting results of LSD's effects on cognitive ability. A team of researchers from Brazil, the UK and Spain, led by Isis Ornelas (Isis M. Ornelas) from the Institute for Research and Education (IDOR) decided to test whether psychedelics' ability to improve memory and learning is linked to neuroplasticity processes. For the first stage, they used induced stem cells to create brain organelles that replicate the brain structure of human embryos. The cells were cultured for 45 days, and then inside each batch the organoids were divided into a control and experimental group and placed in the appropriate solution (LSD or normal nutritional environment). Of the 3448 detected proteins , the expression of 6,8 percent of them in the LSD medium was altered (p &lt; 0,05). The authors then used the Metascape program to learn how biological ways change can be linked. Among them, DNA replication, axonal pathway finding, synaptic vesicular cycle, prolonged depression (synapse, LTD) and the cycle of release of a dopamine neurotransmitter are all regulated by common proteins. Some of these processes are related to the mechanisms of neuroplasticity. In the second stage, the researchers administered a dose of LSD or a saline solution to mice of 0.065, 0.13 or 0.39 milligrams per kilogram using one or three intra-abdominal injections. Three or nine days later, depending on the group, the researchers conducted an experiment on the preference of a new object. The first time they launched the mice was on an experimental site where they had two identical objects and they were allowed to meet them for seven minutes. After half an hour, the mice were launched to the site for three minutes, where one object was replaced by a new one. The mice's preference for a new object was a sign that they remembered the old one. For the analysis, the authors calculated the discrimination index, which they used to study the time of the first and second phases of the experiment. It turns out that the mice that were given LSD injections spent more time researching the new object, regardless of the dose. The greatest effect was seen at an average dose of 0.13 milligrams per kilogram. To study the effects of LSD on humans, the authors invited 25 subjects over the age of 21 who already had experience of taking the substance. At the first session, participants took 50 micrograms of LSD, and then two weeks later at the second session, they took a placebo. To assess the memory performance, participants were asked to perform two tasks for visual-spatial memory: a task for localizing a two-dimensional object and a test of complex figures. The procedure for the first and second sessions was not different, only the stimulating material (images of animals and figures) changed. In the first task, an hour before taking the LSD dose, participants were shown 15 pairs of animal-picture cards: first, one card for one second, then the second, for three seconds. Then the researchers showed the first pair of cards and asked the participants to open the second pair of cards from the overturned cards on the board. After each test subject's answer, the experimenter would show the correct location of the map. The procedure continued until the participant gave 60 percent correct answers for the entire set of cards. The procedure was repeated 24 hours later, but now the experimenter was showing the first two cards in a different order and not showing the correct answers. The second task was given to participants in the morning after taking a dose of LSD or a placebo. The experimenter gave instructions to reshape a complex figure consisting of a multitude of black lines that he showed the participants. He then tore all the leaves and asked the subjects to draw the same figure by memory. He asked them to draw the figure again 20 to 30 minutes later, but he didn't warn them in advance. For analysis, the score was calculated on 18 pieces of the figure, taking into account the correctness of their squaring and location  from 0 to 36 points. The LSD reception improved the participants' passing rates for both tasks: the percentage of correct answers in the card task was significantly higher (p = 0,022), and the difficult figure task had higher scores when checked immediately after studying the figure (p = 0,044), but not after half an hour. So the authors showed that taking LSD affects the plasticity of the brain, with some of the processes, such as DNA replication and axonal orientation, being associated with early stages of neuroplasticity. They also found that LSD increased the desire to study a new object in mice, and in humans, it had a positive effect on memory, improving the processes of consolidation, coding, and reproduction. We've written about the history of LSD in the paper \"Heaven in Diamonds\". Anastasia Lyashenko"

    "translated_title": "People have shown a stronger attachment to devices with gender-specific attributes.",
    "translated_text": "When developers give technology gender specifications, like giving products female or male names, people tend to more humanise them. This was discovered by American scientists who surveyed people about their perceptions of devices and their attitudes toward them. And humanisation involves attachment, and people are more attached to these devices than to their gender-neutral counterparts. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. Tech manufacturers often use gender in their products. So soon, the number of voice assistants installed will be comparable to the population of Earth. And over 90 percent of them have female-like voices. It could be because people associate gender stereotypes with women, like courtesy or respect. And when the creators assign a gender to an object, the product acquires certain traits and roles in the eyes of the user that the user associates with a specific gender. An anthropomorphic product is more responsive to consumers, more trusted and more bought. However, it is still unclear how much users are attached to the technology depending on its gender. They decided to test it out on Ashley Martin (Ashley E. Martin) from Stanford University and Malia Mason (Malia F. Mason, from Columbia University. First, they looked at Amazon's dust-pulling robot reviews and looked at what language people use to describe gadgets. It turns out that the owners of the pollen collectors who attributed gender to their devices and called them \"he/she\" were more likely to use language that indicated affection. The researchers then conducted four studies to determine whether technology's gender had an effect on its incarnation and the owner's attachment to it. They looked at data from 1,013 participants, with an average age of 36, and almost half of them were women. The first two studies involved both existing and potential owners of dust-robots. First, they were asked to assess the validity of statements such as, \"I like my vacuum cleaner\" or \"I feel connected to this product\". On this basis, scientists calculated the strength of the attachment to the dust. In addition, the test subjects were asked to rate the humanity of their gadget  on a scale of 0 to 100. It turns out that the owners who assigned gender to their pollen collector rated it as more human and felt a greater attachment to it (p &lt;0.001). The researchers asked potential owners to describe the human qualities of the vacuum cleaner in the picture, describe its characteristics, and then tell them how much they were willing to buy it and how much they could be attached to it. Scientists have found a significant link between the gender of technology and how people evaluate its anthropomorphity, their attachment to it, and their intention to buy the device. In the third study, scientists evaluated the strength of people's attachment to a voice assistant. The first thing that the subjects had to do was to describe the assistant with a female, male or gender-neutral voice with a few sentences and imagine what the product would be like and how it would behave. As a result, \"female\" and \"male\" assistants scored more points on the humanisation scale than gender-neutral ones (average 63,2, 64,8 and 42,2 points out of 100, respectively, p &lt;0.001). And by scoring their affinity from 1 to 7, participants noted less connection to a gender-neutral voice assistant compared to a \"male\" or \"female\" (average of 3,9, 4,5 and 4,6 points respectively). Also, the subjects were much less willing to buy a gender-neutral assistant. In the final study, participants were presented with different variants of the description of the Miuu unmanned vehicle using the pronouns \"he\", \"she\" or without gender. Participants were asked to consider what it would be like to own this car and then assess its humanity, its recognition and its stereotypical gender traits (such as being confident or feminine) and its attachment to it. In another version of this study, scientists used the names \"Miuu\", \"Jasper\", and \"Iris\" to denote gender. As in previous studies, participants found \"women's\" and \"men's\" cars more human than gender-neutral ones. In addition, scientists have noted the influence of gender on the expression of gender stereotypes. The male features were more often attributed to cars as \"men\", and the female features were attributed to cars as \"women\". True, the participants gave the \"male\" machines a little more \"female\" traits than the gender-neutral ones. In addition, the participants were again less attached to the latter. The researchers concluded (and verified it statistically) that the assigned gender enhances the humanity of the product  and this helps attach to it, since it is easier to attach to a person than to a machine. At the same time, gender attribution reinforces gender stereotypes. But this effect may not be extended to other cultures. The authors note that only Americans participated in the study. It's also unclear whether the gender of the device influences other characteristics of the owner's behavior, such as trust in technology and willingness to pay for it. The researchers write that in their work, these parameters were less dependent on the assigned gender, and therefore need to be studied separately. Scientists have previously found that the gender of a robot does not affect people's willingness to entrust it with a task, even if it is associated with a particular gender in society."

    "translated_text": "Archaeologists presented the results of repeated excavations of the fifth Pazyriksky gorge, first explored in 1949. They extracted the exterior of the chief's burial structure, uncovered an unknown abutment containing ancient artifacts: a shovel fragment, parts of a wagon and a piece of wood covered with gold foil. Other finds in the quarry included carpet fragments, woolly ornaments of horse-drawn carpets, and items left by archaeologists in the middle of the last century. This is reported in an article published in Archaeological Research in Asia. For more than 150 years, researchers have been studying the Pazyric archaeological culture of the early Iron Age (VIIII century BC), which belongs to the Scythian culture circle. They are united by the so-called \"skif triad\", which includes similar weapons, elements of horse gear and the so-called animal art style. The monuments of the Pazyrik culture are mainly concentrated in the territory of the Altai Mountains, where, in particular, in 1993 they found the mummy of a woman known as \"Princess of Ukok\" (more about her in our material \"Good preserved\"). In addition, the monuments of the pagans are also outside Russia  in Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Xinjiang. The most famous monument of this culture  the fifth Pazyrick Kurgan  was excavated by archaeologists in 1949. It is located in the Pazyrik Mountains on the high Ulaanbaatar plateau. The monument is a 42-meter-diameter, 4-meter-high mound with a large burial pit of about 55 square meters. Inside, archaeologists discovered a double-crushed chamber, covered with wood from the top. Although the burial site itself was robbed in ancient times, archaeologists have found valuable materials inside, preserved by an ice lens. In a five-meter deposit, scientists found mummified bodies of a 55-year-old Pazyriqi leader and his wife. The moor also contained nine horses (merins) buried nearby, in a wrecked form, a wooden wagon. Among the finds made on this monument were also samples of Chinese silk, a huge carpet of white silk with bright plotlines, a repeated scene of the rider approaching the goddess sitting on a throne (or chair). In the grave, this carpet was in the horse compartment. Among the many other finds, including well-preserved wooden artifacts, archaeologists have identified domestic goat skin, since it was not known whether these animals were part of herds of herds. Precious finds from this quarry, including a wooden wagon, are on display at the State Hermitage. Nikita Konstantinov of the Upper Altai State University together with colleagues from Novosibirsk and St. Petersburg in 20172019 conducted pre-investigation of the fifth Pazyriksky curgan, first excavated in 1949. Archaeologists note that the constant moisture and permafrost have preserved the organic material from the time of the excavations. It turned out that the tomb pit was almost in situ with the outer crate of the burial structure and the pillars-support for the ceiling above the overlay (part of the structure was dug in 1949 and taken to the Hermitage for storage). After all the wooden structures were lifted from the pit, researchers discovered a previously unknown hole measuring 1.3×1.5×0.8 meters in the south wall. This niche contained a horn barrier, carriage parts, and a piece of wood covered with gold foil. Scientists noted that the size of the outer cutting in its lower part is about 7×4 meters, and the height of the walls  about two meters. The logs contain one to ten stumps made of silk. These insects helped the spiders to put the body together. Preservation of many timber, including the undercutting layer, has been good. This allowed the researchers to select 26 spires and 14 cores for dendrochronological analysis. In the future, this will allow us to determine the exact year of the Siberian leaf litter (Larix sibirica), from which the grove was built. In addition, scientists have determined the age of these trees. The thickest of these, which were used as pillars, was about 250-260 years. The ages of the others ranged from 154 to 194. During excavations, archaeologists also discovered horse remains, including preserved soft tissue, pieces of brick from the cutting ceilings, fragments of wool and gold foil, and a wooden shovel. Other finds included numerous fragments of carpet with sphinx, woolly ornaments of horse-drawn equipment, bronze plates covered with gold foil, and some other artifacts. In addition, the scientists also found the remains of the 1949 expedition. They found a staircase, two stairs (one of which was made of timber taken from the tomb), a top, a metal casket, and newspaper clippings. Previously, N + 1 already talked about the research of the Pazyrick monuments. For example, Barnaval archaeologists have examined a gold plate from the Pazyrick quarry and concluded that it depicts a predatory camel. In addition, Chinese scientists found 26 gold plates in the form of stolen tiger and pigeon heads in the burial ground."

    "translated_title": "The genomes of 700 Malagasy people point to their long-term isolation of Austronesian ancestors",
    "translated_text": "Geneticists examined the DNA of 700 Malagasy people and found that their Austronesian ancestors had been genetically isolated for centuries when the effective size of the population was limited to a few hundred people. But about a thousand years ago, they mixed with the East African Bantu population, and then Madagascar began to grow rapidly. It was accompanied by the extinction of the local megafauna. This is reported in an article published in the journal Current Biology. Madagascar's population is mainly Malagasy, with more than 25 million people today. It is believed that about 1200-1600 years ago, a group of Indonesians who spoke Austronesian arrived on the island. Among the modern population, they are closest to the residents of south Kalimantan. About a thousand years ago, they were mixed with an African population that was genetically related to the Bantu-speaking East African tribes. Full-genome analysis showed that the African ancestral component in Malagasy is about 59.4 ± 0.4 percent, and the Asian  36.6 ± 0.4 percent. Another 3.9 ± 0.1 percent is for the western Eurasian component. African haplogroups are more common in East Asian and mitochondrial DNA analysis (50.1 vs. 42.4 percent), and Y-chromosome lines (70.7 vs. 20.7 percent). The Malagasy language is also related to the Austronesian language, which was influenced by Bantu, Arabic, and some other languages. Pierre Denis of the University of Paul Sabatte, along with colleagues from Germany, Madagascar, Portugal, France and Sweden, continued his studies of the origins of Malagasy. To do this, they studied the genetic profiles of 700 people from different parts of Madagascar and 3,464 people from other populations, focusing their attention on identity by origin (IBD). Using software, scientists have confirmed past conclusions that Malagasy people are related to the East African Bantu populations and Austronesian populations of southern Kalimantan. The genomes of modern Madagascar's inhabitants have formed ten clusters thanks to differences accumulated about 2030 generations ago. Scientists have discovered an interesting feature. So if you look at the whole genome, the African ancestors of the Malagasy are about 60 percent, and the East Asian ancestors are about 40 percent. However, the identical genome segments are more likely to be of Asian origin than African origin. This is a feature that is common to all Malagasy clusters. Scientists have calculated that the Asian ancestors of the Malagasy lived in long-term genetic isolation between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago. Researchers estimate that the effective size of this population was only a few hundred people for decades. About a thousand years ago, the isolation ended when this group mixed with Africans, whose effective population size was significantly higher than  about 27403,000 people. After the mixing of Asian and African ancestors, the Malagasy population grew very rapidly. Researchers estimate that between 1,000 and 300 years ago, the effective size of the population increased about a hundredfold. This demographic boom led to a significant expansion of agricultural land and the extinction of the local megafauna. This is not the first time that human activity in Madagascar has been linked to the extinction of local fauna. Paleoclimate reconstructions have shown that giant lemurs, epiornissas, dronts, and other megafauna have survived on the island for millennia, despite periodic droughts. But they all disappeared after the expansion of humans."

    "translated_text": "The Danuri probe, which became South Korea's first lunar instrument, sent the first image of Earth and the Moon to Earth. The engineers confirmed the functionality of a camera that looked at the moon's reverse side from a distance, reports the Korean Institute of Astronomy and Space Sciences (KARI) website. KPLO (or \"Danuary\") was launched into space in early August of this year, becoming the first interplanetary spacecraft for South Korea, which she created with the support of NASA. The machine is equipped with five scientific instruments: three cameras, a magnetometer and a gamma-spectrometer. The Danuri program includes the study of the structure and composition of the Moon's surface, its magnetic field, moon waves, as well as the search for ice in permanently shaded craters near the Moon's poles and the experiment to create a stable communication channel with the Earth. On August 26, 2022, \"Danuari\" received the first image of Earth and Moon using a high-resolution LUTI camera (LUnar Terrain Imager). At the time of filming, the probe was 1.24 million kilometers away from the planet, which is 12,000 times the working distance to take a picture of the moon's surface. So the engineers wanted to test the camera's functionality. The image shows Australia and Asia, and in the case of the Moon  its reverse side and part of the visible side, the dark Moscow Sea, the Eastern Sea, the impact pool South Pole  Aitken, as well as the young impact crater Jackson, with bright, bright rays. Scientists also note that the magnetometer of the device recorded a significant drop in the magnetic field voltage five hours after launch, suggesting a transition of the Earth's magnetosphere boundary and helping to clarify its model. On September 2, the Danube made its second trajectory correction maneuver, and on December 17th, it was scheduled to go into lunar orbit. After that, the probe will move into a 100-kilometer polar orbit, where it will begin a scientific program designed for at least a year. Earlier, we talked about how South Korea successfully launched its own-developed rocket. Alexander Voytyk"

    "translated_text": "An American engineer modified his eye prosthesis by installing a bright LED that can be used as a flashlight. It's magnetized and runs for 30 hours. The footage with different versions of the prosthesis was posted on the engineer's TikTok account. After losing an eye due to injury or illness, people usually have an eye prosthesis that visually mimics the real eye. One is that it's already very helpful to people, especially psychologically when interacting with other people. There are also early developments that partially restore the ability to perceive visual stimuli. But there are some projects where scientists and engineers do not restore lost functions, but add new ones that are not typical of the natural eye. For example, there is a prosthesis for people with partial retinal detachment equipped with a telescopic lens that allows you to see objects far and small better. American engineer Brian Stanley modified several passive eye prostheses that originally served only an aesthetic function by equipping them with LEDs. He got into prosthetics after losing one eye to cancer. He initially created passive prosthetics, like the Rammstein logo, and then decided to incorporate LEDs into them. He incorporated a red light-emitting diode and patterns into some of the prosthetics, making them look like the eyes of characters in science fiction films and games. And in the latest version, Brian installed a powerful white LED to use the prosthesis as a flashlight. To keep it from continuously lighting, the engineer fitted it with a magnetic field sensor that would allow the lamp to be turned on and off by conducting a magnet alongside it. When the light is on, it can light a room in the dark or read books. Brian notes that the LED does not heat up much after long use, and the battery allows it to operate for 20 hours in bright light and another about 10 hours at significantly less brightness. Self-made electronics aren't just for the eyes. Over 20 years ago, people first started putting RFID tags under their skin.

    "translated_title": "Chemists advised not to press the reaction of hydrophilization",
    "translated_text": "Chemists in Germany have discovered that the industrial cobalt hydrophobic reaction catalyst can work at lower carbon dioxide pressure. They studied the behavior of the catalytic system in detail and concluded that the reaction output does not depend on the original pre-catalyst, and that the pressure of the carbon dioxide in 15 bar is sufficient for the process to proceed successfully. The study was published in Science. In the process of hydrophilization, a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen (synthesis gas) reacts to the double bond in the molecule to form a single bond, and a carbonyl group  joins one of the carbon atoms to form an aldehyde. So in industry, they get all the necessary aldehydes, but they use different catalysts for different sources. In the case of aldehydes with a short carbon chain, phosphine-based birth catalysts are used, and in the case of long branched aldehydes, cobalt is used. As a precatalizer, different sources of cobalt can be used. All of them under reaction conditions are converted to HCo(CO) 4. The usual conditions of industrial hydrofilling  synthesis gas pressure from 100 to 400 bar and reaction mixture temperature from 100 to 250 degrees Celsius. Hard conditions are needed for the process to be fast and the catalyst to work efficiently. However, there are works in which chemists use softer conditions to hydrophilicate the cobalt, and the reaction is still going on. To address this contradiction, chemists led by Robert Franke of Ruhr University in Bohemia decided to study in detail the hydrophobic reaction catalyzed by cobalt carbonyl. They studied the literature and found an article in which the authors argued that hydrophilic formulation could be performed at 140 degrees and 50 bar (25 bar hydrogen and 25 bar carbon dioxide). But this required the use of phosphate complexes of cobalt, and conventional labyl ligand sources, such as acetyl acetate cobalt, did not produce good results. The chemists decided to repeat the experiments, but they were unable to reproduce the results of the article. To the surprise of scientists, the phosphine catalyst was working poorly, but the usual acetyl acetate of cobalt Coac, which in situ turned into HCo, produced 70% of the n-octane aldehyde after two hours of reaction. Confused by their own and others' results, chemists decided to test different reaction conditions. They took several sources of acetyl acetate cobalt, carbonyl Co2 ((CO) 8) and two complexes of cobalt with dioxin and conducted a hydrophilic reaction with them at 140 degrees and a gas synthesis pressure of 50 bar. All catalysts gave similar octane outputs, and chemists concluded that under these conditions the catalytically active carbonyl HCo(CO)4 is stable in the reaction mixture, which gives the product. To confirm this, chemists used an AI spectrometer connected to an autoclave with a reactive mixture. As they predicted, the pre-catalyst will be converted into carbonyl at the beginning of the reaction, which catalyzes the reaction. When chemists repeated the experiment at an even lower synthesis gas pressure of 30 bar, the reaction was still going on, and the concentration of the catalytically active carbonite HCo(CO) 4 dropped very slowly. As a result, chemists have shown that the hydrophilic forming of alkenes does not require the harsh conditions that are now used in industry. For a successful reaction, a synthesis gas pressure of 30 bar and a temperature of 140 degrees Celsius was sufficient, and a threshold of 20 bar and 160 degrees Celsius was reached. Under these conditions, the catalyst decomposed 59 percent in 21 hours. Because of the vast amount of information about different reactions, it often happens that chemists not only use the unoptimal conditions of the process, but also add an expensive catalyst to the reaction mixture that is not needed to run the reaction. One of these cases we talked about recently on N + 1. Michael Boim"

    "translated_title": "Neutral atoms have solved optimization problems",
    "translated_text": "Physicists have assembled a system of neutral atoms capable of generating entangled states and implementing quantum algorithms. Unlike its predecessors, the new computer proved more stable and scalable thanks to the use of long-lived cubic atoms. The work was published in Nature. The difficulty of scaling quantum computers lies not only in preparing stable and correct qubits, but also in performing operations on them with high precision. In the Gett model, quantum valves are responsible for the latter, which is quite difficult to make perfect, so increasing the number of qubits helps correct errors. Scientists have already been able to implement single- and double-cubic valves in a neutral atom system, and the atoms themselves have been able to be well built into two-dimensional arrays and measured. Combining the two experiments allows us to talk about the scalability of quantum computing on neutral atoms. This is exactly what physicists at the University of Wisconsin in Madison led by Mark Saffman did. The authors managed to trap an array of atoms, and they prepared a tangled state and demonstrated the work of two quantum algorithms. The mass of the Cesium atoms was formed by a mesh of optical beams that could be seen on another part of the camera, which recorded the fluorescence from the captured atoms. All the schemes needed to confuse and solve problems using quantum algorithms were assembled from a set of universal valves. For example, a powerful pulsed microwave source was required to perform general rotations, and a laser with a wavelength of 459 nanometers was required for local rotations in the plane. Using the compiled calculator, the authors prepared the Greenberger-Horn-Chailinger state (GHZ state) for a multipart system. It is known for describing the maximum intertwined particle system and is a superposition of states where all particles are in a state of 0 or in a state of 1 with equal probabilities. Even a single cube error can destroy the GHZ state, so creating and maintaining them is pretty difficult. However, scientists have already been able to create 24-particle states for superconducting qubits and 20-particle states for neutral atoms. In the latter case, the cubits were encoded with states with a short life time (two microseconds for a state with four cubits). The authors have been able to create as many The six-second state atomic cubits whose lifetime exceeds previous results in 500 times. Next stage of the capability check calculator  implementing the algorithm phase approximation (QPE). Algorithm allows calculate the phase of the operating operator I'm not going to be able to do it for my own money. Most of the time It's used for quantum chemistry tasks when modeling complex systems. The energy levels of atoms. One by one. part of the algorithm scheme is responsible for Preparing your own condition The second one contains information. and measuring the condition in a suitable I'm going to set the bases. With the help of the The scientists have calculated the minimum The energy of the hydrogen bond in the molecule. Another challenge faced by physicists using a quantum algorithm  task on the maximum cut of the column: it is necessary to divide The top of the column is divided into two groups, And that's the greatest number of lines. The task It's a complexity class NP, so as the size increases, the time it takes to test it doesn't increase polynomially. The most popular and an efficient algorithm for solving MaxCut of the quantum computing task  approximation algorithm (QAOA) The connection between the top of the column It's a matrix, and it's a matrix. The quantum language problem can be solved I'm going to make a Hamilton. Then The solution of the problem will be the existence of its own values It's a Hamiltonian. The algorithm itself Similar to the previous one  one part of the scheme used for preparing the condition, The second measures this state at the base. It's a Hamiltonian. The iterative algorithm He's learning to prepare a state that You get the minimum number when you measure. The scientists used four cubits to QAOA and managed to solve the problem For a three- and four-pointed graph. Although the results of the work far from the record highs that they're showing other platforms, the authors point to importance of work in the development of quantum The first is the computation of neutral atoms. They are . The report also states that the  a technical issue that They already have answers, and what they're They plan to decide in the near future. A similar algorithm was already being used by the photon calculator. In addition to implementing already known algorithms and solving classic problems, theorists explore the possibility of \"combining\" problems so that they can be solved with fewer qubits. Sometimes scientists don't even force a quantum computer to solve a problem, they just test the validity of a solution and find out that the quantum processor turns out to be faster than the classic one.

Report on the work published It's in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. Excess body weight is one of the world 's biggest problems . She's suffering from health problems.

And that's why a group of researchers from the US, UK and South Korea under the leadership of Chen Liu of the South-West Medical The University of Texas Center decided to investigate the anorexic potential of this called triptans (agonists of 5-HT1B/1D-receptors), which are widely used to treat migraine attacks. In the first phase of the experiment , the hungry mice were injected with six of various triptans (zolmitriptan, almotriptan, raizitriptan, natriptan, Electriptan and fravatriptan) and compared their food intake with control The group. Four of these drugs are statistically significant.

It turns out that the direct involvement in this process is secretion of agute-related peptide (AgRP) of the arcuate nucleus neurons (ARC) and their projections in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). The key role of the melanocortin-activated glutametergic nerve pathway ARC→PVH in regulating the effects of leptin and the green wine, food behavior and energy exchange were shown and I've been here before.

    "translated_title": "Chromatine in a living cell has shown fluid properties",
    "translated_text": "French biophysicists have studied the movement of chromatin  complexes of DNA and proteins  inside a living cell using magnetic nanoparticles. The result was that the chromatin moves inside the nucleus not as a gel formed from a sewn polymer network, but as a viscous fluid. The study was published in Science. Information about matrix RNAs that encode proteins is written in genes. Genes, in turn, make up DNA. And the DNA of eukaryotes, along with proteins, is a chromatin that is embedded in linear chromosomes. The state of chromatin and its specific motion affect the availability of genes for reading and synthesis on their RNA matrix, so how chromatin moves inside the cell nucleus is of interest to scientists. Despite the interest, most of the methods that scientists use to induce chromatin movement inside a cell are quite crude. They're based on applying force to the entire cell at once, to the cell nucleus or to large areas of the genome. While there is no way to apply force to small chromatin segments yet. To correct this and to explore the mechanics of chromatin in more detail, biophysicists led by Antoine Coulon of the Curie Institute decided to use magnetic nanoparticles. They made nanoparticles based on ferritin, attached to two fluorescent proteins and a tetracycline repressor. And in chromatin cells, scientists artificially inserted sequences from tetracycline operators. Biophysicists assumed that in the cells being studied, the operators would communicate with the repressors, and the magnetic nanoparticles would be in a certain chromatin region. And we can observe them through protein fluorescence. So scientists inserted magnetic nanoparticles into the cells, and most of them were attached to the right chromatin region inside the cell nucleus. To apply force to nanoparticles, biophysicists used microscopic rods that attracted magnetic nanoparticles to themselves in the presence of an external magnetic field. To investigate the properties of chromatin in the cell nucleus, scientists conducted a series of experiments that turned on and off the external magnetic field in a matter of minutes. The force acting on the nanoparticles was not greater than a few piconutons. In the process of these experiments, the authors observed a certain chromatin (locus) plot being aligned and moving in the direction of the magnetic rod, and when the external field was turned off, it would gather and return a certain distance back. To describe the motion of the locus, scientists decided to use Rause's model from polymer physics  it describes the motion of a single-chain polymer, which consists of monomers connected by oscillating springs, in a tight environment. And despite the simplicity of this model, the predicted dependence of the force applied to the locus by the displacement matched well with the experimental data. And while some of the data didn't match predicted, scientists linked it to additional locus interactions with nearby chromatin chains. The modification of Rause's theory, taking these interactions into account, gave even more accurate matches to the experimental data. Since Rause's theory describes single-chain polymers that do not form a sewn polymer network, the behavior of chromatin in the nucleus, according to biophysicists, resembles that of a liquid. In earlier studies, scientists have suggested that chromatin behaves like a viscous gel formed by sewn polymer chains. The results showed that a small amount of force applied to the piconutone was enough to move chromatin within a few micrometers of a living cell, and the movement itself resembled the movement of a liquid more than a spliced polymer. But the authors point out that their findings contradict earlier studies, where the behavior of chromatin was similar to that of gel. Therefore, scientists believe that further research into chromatin should be done without introducing artificial sequences that could affect the results of experiments. Although the movement of chromatin has not yet been thoroughly studied, much work has been done on its structure and packaging in the nucleus. For example, we recently talked about how, thanks to improved staining, researchers were able to study the three-dimensional structure of chromatin directly inside the cell. Michael Boim"

    "translated_text": "The Mars Rover Perseverance, as part of the second phase of the scientific program, has arrived at the ancient river delta in the Lake crater and is ready to begin drilling. The rover is expected to be able to find traces of potential microbial life forms that may have existed in the lake several billion years ago, according to NASA's website. Perseverance is the fifth and most advanced NASA Mars lander to arrive on the Red Planet in February 2021. The rover's tasks include studying the planet's surface layer and its climate, searching for bio-signatures, and collecting soil samples into sealants, which will then be sent to Earth as part of the Mars Sample Return Mission (MSR) program. In addition, the rover delivered the first unmanned helicopter to Mars, which is still in operation. The first phase of the rover 's scientific program started last summer and took 400 sols (Marsyan days). Within it, the rover moved south of the landing site, exploring the rock exposures at the bottom of the Lake crater, then returned to the landing site and began to advance north, heading towards the ancient river delta. During this time, the Perseverance received eight cores of mountain breeds, one sample of Mars' atmosphere and one control sample, and also confirmed the existence of a lake in a crater in the distant past. The second phase of the scientific program began on April 18, 2022 and will take about half a year. During this time, the rover will rise up the delta and obtain samples of layered sedimentary rocks that formed several billion years ago in the presence of liquid water. If life forms actually existed on Mars at that time, the remains or traces of these organisms could have been preserved in some of the species and affected by their mineral composition. Previously, the rover was moving to the delta bypassing large sand dunes, and in the nearest salt marshes it will arrive at the Hawksville Gorge, the first sample collection site called \"Devils Tanyard\". The Mars rover will then climb up the gorge and make four more stops to conduct geological surveys. The resulting kernels are expected to include samples of small-grain clay argilites, which are good candidates for preserving organic matter and potential ancient microbes, as well as large-grain sand dunes to limit the lifespan of Lake Lake.

    "translated_title": "Spectrum-RG saw the \"fire ball\" of a new star for the first time.",
    "translated_text": "Astronomers have confirmed the existence of a \"fire ball\" of volatile matter that arises during the burst of new stars and is visible as an X-ray burst preceding an optical burst. This was achieved during observations by the eROSITA X-ray telescope of the Spectrum-RG space observatory following the New Grid explosion in 2020. The article was published in Nature. The new outbreak is a sharp increase in brightness of some stars and occurs in close binary systems that contain a white dwarf and a normal star. In such systems, the white dwarf absorbs the companion star substance that accumulates in its outer layer, which is accompanied by an increase in temperature. At some point, this layer is triggered by uncontrollable reactions of hydrogen fusion into helium, which results in a powerful flare that covers the entire dwarf, but does not destroy it. In the future, the dwarf will start accumulating hydrogen near its photosphere again and the outbreak will repeat itself in tens or thousands of years. The theory predicts that after the outer layer of the white dwarf begins to synthesize, a phase of the \"fire ball\" should be observed, which would look like a short bright burst of soft X-ray radiation before the new one becomes visible in the optical range. However, this phenomenon has not yet been recorded, although it was originally predicted 30 years ago. A group of astronomers led by Ole König of the University of Erlangen's astronomical institute Nuremberg reported that they had first seen a new \"fire ball\". This was done during observations of the New Grid, which exploded on July 15, 2020, with the eROSITA X-ray telescope installed on board the Spectrum-RG space observatory when it conducted a second survey of the sky. The outbreak was classical and occurred in a cataclysmic variable of the type VY Sculptor, which contains an He/N-white dwarf and is 8,2 thousand light-years from the Sun. The X-ray burst began 11 hours before the nine-fold increase in brightness in the optical range and lasted less than 8 hours. The spectrum of the outburst can be described by a model of the white dwarf's atmosphere, heated to 327,000 kelvins, and the dwarf's mass was estimated at 0.98 solar masses, which is quite a lot. Thus, the existence of X-ray bursts has now been observed and eROSITA is expected to be able to detect several more such events in its further work. Earlier, we talked about how eROSITA data allowed us to find the remnants of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy and connect Fermi bubbles to the activity of a supermassive black hole.

    "translated_text": "Astronomers have discovered the youngest exoplanet in the giant class, HD 114082b, which is only 15 million years old. It is thought that a planet eight times more massive than Jupiter formed by the accretion of matter from the near-stellar disk to a solid core. A print of the work describing the discovery is published on the arXiv website. The first is the Internet. By mid-2022, the number of exoplanets discovered had surpassed five thousand, but only a tenth of these objects are known to have both mass and radius, which is important for describing their internal structure. There are only two very young star systems, not older than 50 million years, that contain well-studied exoplanets, which is not enough to test theoretical models of planet formation. So to make models more accurate, we need to increase the number of known exoplanets and define their parameters, especially for very young systems. A group of astronomers led by Olga Zakhozhay of the Max Planck Society's Institute of Astronomy reported the discovery of an exogeny in a very young star HD 114082, located 310 light-years from the Sun. The discovery was originally made using the FEROS spectrograph, installed on the La Silla Observatory's 2.2-meter telescope, as part of the RVSPY review. To confirm this, the authors used observations from the HARPS ground spectrograph and the Gaia and TESS space telescopes. HD 114082 has a mass of 1.47 masses, a radius of 1.49 masses and is of spectral type F3 V. The age of the candle is estimated at only 15±6 million years, and it is surrounded by a near-stellar disk of debris, shaped like a narrow dust ring with a radius of 28 astronomical units. HD 114082b was assigned to warm super Jupiters, an exoplanet with a mass of 8 Jupiters and a radius comparable to Jupiter's. It is in an orbit characterized by a large hemisphere of 0.51 astronomical units and an eccentricity of 0.4, which is comparable to Mercury's orbit, but more elongated. Scientists have identified HD 114082b as the youngest known exoplanet. Its properties fit better into the cold start model, where the planet is formed by the accretion of near-stellar disk matter to a solid core, rather than the hot start model, which is associated with gravitational instability in the disk. We've talked about how astronomers confirmed the collision of two exoplanets in a young system and how the young exogynists failed to fit the theoretical models of the compression velocity."

    "translated_title": "The twisted bison became a ferromagnetic by laser",
    "translated_text": "Physicists have managed to turn a twisted bisel from the dihalcogenides of transition metals into a ferromagnetic by emitting laser light. The theory showed that the effect could be explained by wandering exitons that act as intermediaries between the spines located in the cells of the muoralistic lattice. The study was published in Nature. The permanent magnet is a remarkable example of how the quantum phase in which matter is present manifests itself on a macroscopic scale. Ferromagnetism is due to the collective interaction of individual atomic magnetic moments. And while we understand how a magnetic order is created in a regular piece of iron, we can't control and study it in detail because access to individual atoms in this case is difficult, and their vast amount makes any such manipulation ineffective. Artificial materials have become a new paradigm in magnetic order research, in which ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism can be simulated or reproduced under well-controlled conditions using quasi-atoms or quasi-networks. The latter type includes studies in layered materials twisted relative to each other into small angles. In this case, the material creates an additional periodicity called a muar supergrid. We've already told you how physicists found ferromagnetism by twisting a even and an odd number of antimagnetic layers of chromium iodide. Another promising class of materials was the dihalcogenides of transition metals. For example, the introduction of impurities into a two-layer tantalum disulfide transformed it from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic. And recently, physicists were able to see the fragile ordered state of electron density of the Wigner crystal, twisting the layer of tungsten disulfide relative to tungsten disulfide. Now scientists are actively trying to enrich their tools to control the properties of charge carriers in muar supergrids by including optical methods, for example. Physicists from Hong Kong, the United States, and Japan, led by Wang Yao of Washington University and Xiaodong Xu of Hong Kong University, have investigated how optical excitation can affect the spine-to-spine interactions between charge carriers localized in muar supergrid cells. This way they were able to obtain a ferromagnetic order in a twisted bisel of disulfide and tungsten diselenyde. For this purpose, physicists created a hetero structure that, in addition to the dichalogenic twisted bisel, consisted of additional layers of boron nitride and graphene, as well as additional electrodes connected to the layers. The Muar supergrid, formed in a bisel, had a period equal to 7.5 nanometers. By controlling the voltages on the electrodes, the authors could fill its cells with holes or electrons at the right concentration. Then the physicists radiated the sample with laser pulses of variable circular polarization. This, on the one hand, resonated with the sulfur exitons in the selenide, which became interlayered almost immediately, and on the other hand, helped measure the magnetic circular dichroism of the intensity of the reflection of light from the sample. The difference in the reflection of light with different polarization carries information about the magneticity of the surface. The authors studied how this difference signal depends on the degree of cell filling of the muar supergrid and the applied magnetic field. They found that for one hole in three and seven cells, the magnetic field of the sample varied differently depending on which direction the magnetic field was changing. In other words, the researchers observed hysteresis characteristic of ferromagnetic materials. Physicists have studied in detail how the properties of these burners depend on other conditions of the experiment: hole concentration, temperature, and laser power. They found that hysteresis only appears from a certain threshold of the pump, and its width is saturated with its growth. They also determined the appropriate Curie temperatures at which the sample was able to retain magnetism, which also depended on the experimental conditions. The authors suggested that the patterns observed could be explained by wandering exitons, which are the larger than the more intense laser light. Their estimates suggest that such exitones could mediate between the spines of holes trapped in muorous cells, providing a strong long-range interaction without which ferromagnetic phase formation is impossible. Unfortunately, modeling the hysteresis loop itself is difficult because it requires solving the imbalance problem of many bodies. Every year, physicists are increasingly understanding what muor exitones are. Scientists have recently been able to measure the spatial distribution of electrons and holes in such a quasiparticle.

    "translated_title": "Physicist mathematically burned an infinite coil.",
    "translated_text": "An American physicist modeled the process of cooking an infinitely uniform thin coil. He tried to answer the question of how the coup d'état of the cotillion could speed up the process of its complete preparation. For this, the author solved the optimization task for regimes with a different number of coups. It turns out that one coup already speeds up the cooking considerably, while additional coups do it slightly. The built model, however, has more mathematical than applied benefits. The study was published in Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena. Cooking is a lot like working in a lab. In both cases, the result  is a function of a set of variables, such as the proportions of the ingredients and the time of impact on the sample. Both processes can be linked by the complexity and nonlinearity of the physical and chemical processes that occur. It is no wonder, then, that these areas of human activity often intersect. You can read about how scientists cook in our collection, The Cooking Lab. Food prepared by scientific methods is usually not a goal in itself. Food is often a cheap and visible practical model for studying various physical processes. We've already talked about how breaking wafer can help you better understand the mechanics of composite materials, marinating eggs, diffusion, boiling vegetables, heat conductivity. Theorists also often disguise complex physics as \"eatable\" tasks, such as sliding a solid body from the edge or supersonic motion of gas streams. A similar study was conducted by Jean-Luc Thiffeault of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He wondered how important a coup was when a flat-bottomed kettle was hot. Meat of this shape is usually used as a filling for hamburgers. The physicist built numerical and analytical models of heat, which, it turns out, are in tune with some practical tasks of thermal conductivity and hydrodynamics. The scientist presented the mathematical kettle as an infinite uniform flat with a thickness of one centimeter, which is baked on an infinite oven at 200 degrees Celsius in an atmosphere with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Uniformity meant neglecting the internal dynamics and texture of meat (or other products), including the melting of fat and moisture movement inside the kettle, but allowed the one-dimensional problem of heat conductivity to be solved analytically. The specific thermal conductivity properties of the coil were borrowed from early research by his colleagues. The condition of full readiness was to reach all the hotspots of the boiler at 75 degrees. The heat conduction properties of the hot water bottle's contact with the stew and air played a key role. For example, a physicist has discovered that if a boiler is very quick to heat up the air, the top of the boiler will never cook without a turn. Under realistic conditions, as the model showed, full cooking is possible after 283 seconds. The researcher then introduced instantaneous coil turns into the model. Mathematically, they were matched by an operator that revolved the spatial axis, or, equivalently, that revolved the temperature profile and boundary conditions. The operator, in turn, acted on the components of the Fourier decay, in which the physicist sought a solution to the thermal conductivity equation. He has focused on the possibility of a fairly large number of coups. The solution was to a certain temperature profile, which varied depending on the time between the neighbouring coups. When it was large, the profile was able to align in a linear dependence, otherwise the temperature remained constant in much of the sample, but in the thin border layers oscillated. A similar effect was observed recently by Japanese physicists in an experiment. In the final part of his study, Tifo decided to answer the question of how much and how often to turn the kettle to achieve the minimum cooking time. To do this, he essentially had to solve an optimization problem for every number of coups. The difficulty was that each new coup added a new temporary variable. And if for one or two revolutions, the global minimum can be found graphically by constructing a full cooking time from one or two time intervals, then for the larger number of revolutions, physics has had to use multidimensional search algorithms. For simplicity, the author used a symmetrical case where the contact properties of the kettle are the same above and below. This is possible, for example, if you cook the meat with another metal plate. In this case, regardless of the number of coups (at least once) the coldest point will always remain about the middle of the kettle. For a single-turn mode, it was optimal to do it 36 seconds after the start of the heat, achieving a significant reduction in cooking time of  81 seconds. The local minimum was at the same time asymmetrical: slightly holding the kettle was less critical than slightly not holding it. The further increase in the number of coups after optimization reduced the full cooking time, though slightly. After all, the full-time addiction was aiming for an asymptote of 63 seconds. It is noteworthy that with the increase in the number of coups, the optimal intervals between them were aligned except for the last stage of the heat, which remained long. Tifo stresses that the results of his research are difficult to use for practical purposes, since no chef will turn his kettle 20 times. In addition, his calculations do not take into account many factors, including the heterogeneity of the kettle and the edge effects. However, the model considered by the physicist echoes the modes that occur during the convection of the Reley  Benar. We talked about a practical approach to the problem of meat-burning. American engineers printed chicken pots on a 3D printer and laser-coated them. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_text": "Engineers have eliminated all the hydrogen leakage problems that had previously occurred when refueling the SLS superheavy-carrying rocket, now the rocket is ready for its first flight to the moon. However, the launch date has not yet been determined and may be postponed due to bad weather, NASA's website reports. Initially, the first unmanned flight under the \"Artemis\" program and the first launch of the SLS rocket was scheduled for August 29, 2022, but was canceled due to hydrogen leakage during its pumping through one of the rocket's main stage engines. The second attempt, on September 3, also failed. This time, there were multiple leaks of liquid hydrogen during the refueling of the main stage. After that, the systems were reviewed and repaired, and the launch was postponed indefinitely. On September 21, NASA conducted a demonstration cryogenic test of SLS at the launch pad, which included cooling the rocket and engine fuel supply lines, as well as phases of rapid and slow refueling of the rocket's main and upper stages and pumping hydrogen through the engines to cool them to the desired temperature. A number of pre-launch operations were thus modeled shortly before the launch of the SLS. As a result, all the cryogenic test tasks were successfully completed, after which fuel was pumped from the tanks. At the beginning of the test, a small hydrogen leak occurred in the rapidly disconnecting connection of the hose cable, but it was eliminated. Thus, SLS can be considered ready for first launch or at least minimized the risk of possible problems during the third launch attempt. Currently, the launch date of Artemis-1 is not yet determined. The flight was scheduled for September 27, but the proximity of the tropical storm Yan caused the launch to be postponed, and the Orion rocket was moved from the launch to the building of the vertical assembly. The exact date of the first launch of the SLS will be announced later when weather conditions are favorable. For more information on the Artemis program and the details of the first flight, see the \"Arteemis Mission\" and \"Intermediate Station\" materials by Alexander Voytyk."

    "translated_title": "Recidivists proved key to the corruption model in Spain and Brazil",
    "translated_text": "European and Brazilian scientists compared the structure of corruption scandals in Spain and Brazil by applying network analysis to them. Based on this comparison, they not only identified universal patterns, but they were able to create an abstract model of a corrupt network that reproduced statistical data. The key role in this was played by recidivists  people involved in more than one scandal. The study was published in Scientific Reports. In complex systems, the whole  is almost always more than just the sum of its parts. This is primarily the case with collective human activity, which can be seen in organized crime. In criminal organizations, the ability of its members to self-organize and interact productively is higher than in legal organizations, as they are required to protect and conceal their illegal activities. As complex systems theory developed, a number of researchers tried to apply its findings to the study and investigation of economic crime, organized crime, and corruption. One of these areas was the use of network science, since members of a criminal group are naturally represented as nodes, and interaction between them as connections of some network. The literature mentions the successful use of mathematics to detect cartels, money laundering, drug trafficking, and much more. The problem with this kind of research is that it's hard to get data to build models, especially temporary data, so scientists use whatever information they have available to do that. Researchers are greatly helped by enthusiasts who collect data on all known crimes of the same type in a single country. These resources, which are dedicated to corruption in Brazil and Spain, were used by a group of physicists, mathematicians, and criminologists from Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Slovenia, led by Harold Ribeiro of Maring State University. They have previously analyzed 65 well-documented political corruption scandals that took place in Brazil between 1987 and 2014, involving a total of 404 people. This time, they included data from 437 scandals in Spain between 1989 and 2018, involving 2,753 people, and compared it to a Brazilian sample. For comparison, they presented data as networks where people involved in scandals were nodes, and their relationships were connections. First, the researchers compared the scandal distribution for the two countries by the number of participants. In both cases, it was close to the exponential with similar characteristics: 7.33 and 7.51 people for Spain and Brazil, respectively. The distribution shows that people are mostly grouped together to participate in corruption schemes (only 20 and 17 percent of the time, more than 10 people were involved in the scandal), and the similarity of these patterns has led authors to look for more complex universal patterns. Further analysis only confirmed the similarity of the two countries' corruption networks. They had close clustering coefficients (0.91 vs. 0.93), associative coefficients (0.74 vs. 0.53), average shortest path length (5.11 vs. 2.99) and much more. The evolution of the giant network component, the largest of the unconnected parts of the network, has been similar over time: in both cases, its size has experienced a surge in growth over a given year due to merging with other components. The recidivists, who are involved in more than one corruption scandal, played a major role in this merger. In both cases, the number of recidivists rose linearly as the number of people involved in corruption schemes increased over time. This means that the rate of relapse has always been about constant and equal to 9 percent and 14 percent for Spain and Brazil, respectively. This discovery allowed scientists to construct a simple abstract model of a corrupt network. This model starts with an empty network that expands by including graphs that represent political scandals on each iteration. The number of people in these graphs is randomly selected from an exponential distribution. The probability of recurrence is linearly related to the number of people. Numerical simulations based on this model have shown that the dependence of the size of a giant network component on the chance of meeting a relapse is about 6.5 percent. Below it, the corruption networks are highly fragmented, above  almost entirely made up of one cluster. Thus, the Spanish and Brazilian networks are in this kind of intermediate mode. The authors emphasize that being involved in a corruption scandal does not guarantee that a particular person has been convicted of a crime or committed something illegal. Besides, there's always a chance that one of the corrupt officials could have avoided public scandals. However, the results obtained by the researchers were consistent with the accidental deletion of some of the data. We've talked about how network analysis helped us explore the workings of the Mexican subway and Reddit memes. Marat Hamadeev"

    "translated_title": "Food neurons found in the visual cortex",
    "translated_text": "There are neurons in the ventral visual stream that respond to images of food, American scientists have found. They recognized neural signals that, when standard MRI data were analyzed, were apparently suppressed by other nearby populations. The food neuron buildup is found on both sides of the windward area that's responsible for facial recognition. They've been shown to respond more to ready meals like pizza, but raw vegetables or fruits also do. The article was published in Current Biology. There are two visual information processing systems in the brain. It's the system that answers the question \"What?\" or the ventral visual flow and the system that answers the question \"Where?\" or the dorsal visual flow. The first system distinguishes specific objects, and the second is concerned with processing spatial visual information. Inside the \"What?\" or ventral flow system are separate areas, each of which is activated as a person looks at a certain category of objects  a person, a human body, a place, or text. But the world around us is not exhausted by these visual objects, and there are still areas that have not been discovered that can be linked to the recognition of other categories of objects. A team of researchers led by MIT's Meenakshi Khosla suggested that there were several reasons why it was not possible to identify populations of neurons that respond to other categories (besides faces, bodies, places, and text). First, in previous ventral pathway studies, the material used was relatively small and did not include enough stimuli in each category of objects. Second, the experiments themselves were limited to hypotheses, which led the researchers to find what they were looking for, without paying attention to the categories of stimuli not identified by the hypothesis. Third, the fMRT image consists of a set of voxals  of a two-dimensional pixel analog in three-dimensional space that reflects a small cube of brain tissue. And usually, we analyze the signal from each voxel. But even a single voxel does not contain a single neuron, but hundreds of thousands. And if it turns out that there are neurons in the same voxel that respond to different visual information, then signals from one voxel can mute others from the same voxel. Hossa and her colleagues overcame the limitations of previous studies, in particular, they didn't specify any hypotheses. The scientists used a set of stimuli from 56720 realistic images of various objects. Each of the eight participants in their experiment saw between 5,445 and 10,000 images, and only 515 images were repeated for all subjects. And most importantly, the researchers used nonnegative matrix decomposition to process the fMRI data. This approach, roughly speaking, allowed us to break down signals inside the voxel and thus find neurons that could not be identified in standard FMRI processing. As a result, the researchers found five clusters of neurons in the ventral visual stream, each responding to a single category of objects. Four of them, which were activated on faces, human bodies, places or text, were known before. And the authors think it's a good way to verify their method: the fact that it's allowed to identify these four populations suggests that it works. But the most important thing is the fifth population. She was the one who reacted more to images of food. The discovery was a real discovery: there was no previous report of such neurons in the ventral fluid. Although the food selectivity hypothesis was tested in 1999, it was rejected because researchers did not find a significant difference between the response of neurons to food and other objects. Interestingly, the most powerful responses to food neurons were mostly images of ready-made food, like a slice of pizza, and raw foods like banana, carrots, were rarely on this list. The following is an example of the most popular food in the two neurons in the study, and you can see the popular images for each of the five groups of neurons in the video that the researchers attached to their work. The study was conducted in two phases: the first half of the participants only completed the experiment, and then the other four people completed the second phase. This division of the study helped the authors to see that the results were repeatable. However, at this point, the authors still had doubts about whether the response of this population of neurons was related to images of food, or perhaps to some other characteristic of the object, such as shape, color, or a combination of similar characteristics. To find out, they first compared the reaction of the fifth population of neurons to food and non-food, and to food and non-food that is visually similar to food, but in both cases the reaction to food remains stronger (p &lt;0,00001, p &lt;0,01). Then the researchers trained a convex neural network to predict the responses of the food neurons. They split the set of images they used into two parts. One of them is how the food neurons react to this part of the image they showed the neural networks. The second was a test: the neural network was supposed to predict how the food neurons reacted to the images of the second part. The network's predictions were very accurate (p &lt;0,00001). But scientists have not stopped there. They wondered if the food selectivity of neurons would be maintained even when tested on a much larger set of stimuli? It turns out that the 1,000 images that were predicted to activate the food neurons more than the others were only taken from food. At the same time, none of the thousands of images that were predicted to activate the food neurons were containing it. Moreover, the neuroet predicted a stronger response to food if all images were black and white (p &lt;0,00001), as well as a stronger response to food than to objects that look very similar to it (p = 0.003  for the color variant and p = 0.023  for the black and white version). The authors also used a neural network to analyze a set of images from a 1999 study that rejected the food selectivity hypothesis. And again, the neural network predicted a significantly different reaction to food than other objects (p = 0.007). So the authors found a link between the signals from the neurons in the fifth population and the images of the food, and then they replicated that result. They then made sure that no other images or parts of them caused a similar reaction in the food neurons, and then they expanded their results. Although the latter was successful with some reservations, they noted that a neural network model can only replace neural data to the extent that it is accurate  and since the model does not take into account all deviations, the conclusions based on its predictions are not flawless. But even if the model can cover all the deviations, it doesn't mean that the model uses the same mechanisms as the brain. So the results we've got are going to need to be backed up with actual neuronal data in future studies. Although the Hossel team was able to detect this population, the key question of the study was not exhaustive. Still, faces, human bodies, places, text, and food are far from all the categories of visual information present in our lives. Accordingly, the scientists continued their research to see if any other category of images would lead to a population of neurons selectively responding to this category. The researchers re-analyzed the fMRT data of their eight subjects and reapplied the nonnegative matrix decomposition to them. But this time, the researchers chose the answers from neurons to nine categories that contained roughly the same number of images. Two categories  are people and food  they were used as control. The other seven are clocks, planes, trucks, motorcycles, horses, elephants and giraffes. As a result, nothing but the populations that responded to faces and food, they haven't found yet. When they finished the study, the authors determined where the population of neurons that respond to food selectively is anatomically located. To do this, they correlated signals from neurons with their respective axes, and then found their anatomical coordinates. It turns out that the food neurons lie in two clusters next to the windy part of the curve that's responsible for facial recognition. And the authors suggested that we call the population of food neurons a ventrally food component. In recent decades, not only have specialized neurons been found in the visual cortex, but also, for example, in the temporal bone. Recently, a study has been published that scientists have found in this region of the brain, neurons of addition and subtraction. It's also known that there's a population of neurons in the brain that respond selectively to singing, but not to instrumental music or speech. Catherine Rochny"

    "translated_text": "The National Science Foundation of the United States has decided not to rebuild the radio telescope Aresibos, which was destroyed two years ago. An educational center will be built in its place, which has drawn criticism from many scientists, reports Nature. The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico had a diameter of 305 meters, making it the largest radio telescope with a full aperture before the FAST telescope. Aresibó worked for 57 years and conducted extensive scientific research covering the Earth's ionosphere, the solar system, and stars and galaxies. In mid-2020, the decision was made to stop the telescope due to several cases of cutting the wires supporting the platform with radiators above the main antenna, as repairs were a dangerous event. However, the planned decommissioning of the telescope was prevented by its unexpected destruction in early December 2020. After the destruction of the Aresibos, a long process of clearing the karst vortex from the debris began, with no official announcements about the observatory's future status. Many scientists around the world, including the Aresibos team, hoped that the National Science Foundation (NSF), which runs the observatory, would restore the telescope. In the spring of 2021, a replacement project for the Arecibo, called NGAT (Next Generation Arecibo Telescope), was published, which represents a system of many small parabolic antennas inscribed in a circle with a diameter of 314 to 331 meters, working as a single antenna. The new system should be several times more sensitive, cover most of the sky and have more powerful transmitters. However, on November 14, 2022, NSF announced that it would not restore the radio telescope, as this would require significant financial costs and long analysis. Instead, a science, technology, engineering and math education center will be built, with $1 million to $3 million a year to be allocated over five years, starting in 2023. The funding may include or not include funds for the operation of the observatory's remaining instruments, such as a 12-meter radio antenna and a leading system for Earth's atmosphere. The decision drew criticism from many scientists around the world who hoped for a new telescope. It is also not entirely clear how the new centre will attract new teachers and students unless it is actively involved in astronomical research. The story of Arecibo and the discoveries made by the telescope can be found in the material \"The Great Ear\"."

    "translated_title": "A giraffe's cousin lived 16.9 million years ago and was the owner of a dome for fighter fights.",
    "translated_text": "Paleontologists have described a new fossil offspring of the giraffe that lived in modern China about 16.9 million years ago. Scientists have named it Discokeryx xiezhi. It was distinguished from its relatives by a dome on its head, which the males used to fight for the females. In an article published in the journal Science, the authors note that the long neck of modern giraffes also evolved primarily for fighting. Today, the Giraffoidea superfamily is made up of two genera of giraffe families, whose range is limited to Africa: giraffes (Giraffa) and okapi (Okapia). In addition, a recent study has shown that this superfamily includes the antelope (Antilocapridae), the only modern representative of which is the antelope (Antilocapra americana) that lives in North America. But in the past, Giraffoidea were much more diverse and more widespread. For example, in Africa (from the myocene to the plaistocene) and Eurasia (from the pliocene to the plaistocene) there lived a sivaterium, the back pair of which resembled a moose's horn. The new giraffe was described by Shi-Qi Wang of the Institute of Spine Paleontology and Palaeoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and his colleagues from Germany, China, the United States and Switzerland. The fossils of three individuals were found in 1996-1997 in the Chinese Halamagai Formation, estimated to be 16.9 million years old (end of the early miocene). This giraffe differed from its relatives in that its head was decorated with a disc-like formation. During its life it was covered with several layers of horn-like matter that formed a dome. Paleontologists have named the animal Discokeryx xiezhi. Its genus name is derived from the words \"disc\" and \"horn\", and the genus name is in honor of the unicorn Sechji from Chinese mythology. Scientists believe that the males of the discoquereks encountered these domes when they fought for the females. This is also indicated by the enlarged joints between the neck and the spine and between the atlantic and the posterior bone. Paleontologists have used the finite element method to find that the discoquerx is indeed well suited to head-strikes, much better than other stinging pelvic fins. And given the structure of the joints, it's probably even better than the dinosaurs of the Pachycephalosaurs, which have a bony dome on their heads. The researchers also analyzed the ratio of stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes in the enamels of the teeth of the discoquerx and other plant-eating mammals of the Halamagai formation. The resulting δ13C indicates that the discoquerx was a gray  i.e. fed on grasses and other low-growing plants. And the wide range of δ18O values indicates the use of several water sources (or the seasonality of the climate). In both respects, the discoquerx was very different from all other herbivores in the Halamagai. It suggests that he used food sources that were not available to other animals. Scientists note that modern rodents usually live in low-productive ecosystems: sheep, for example, live in tundra, and sheep, for example, live in mountains. It is therefore possible that the discoquerx lived in marginal (boundary) conditions (but the authors do not specify which). Researchers note that the fossil representatives of the superfamily Giraffoidea show a high variety of \"headwear\" and the new species increases it. This high diversity suggests that male fights played a major role in the evolution of this group. Therefore, according to the authors, the long necks of modern giraffes, with which males fight each other, evolved primarily for fighting, not as a result of competition with other vegetable-eating animals (this hypothesis was proposed earlier). A few years ago, we wrote about the discovery of a new species of giraffe that lived in what is now Spain about ten million years ago. The Seed of Frost"
